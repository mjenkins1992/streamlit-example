      " WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE? What was the purpose of this study? Breast cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the breast. Some women with breast cancer have breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, spinal cord, or spinal cord. This type of cancer is called metastatic breast cancer.  Talazoparib is a medicine that is being tested for the treatment of breast cancer in women. It is used to treat patients with advanced or metastatic cancer of the breast, and it has been shown that it may be effective in treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer (metastatic).  TalAZOPARIB (BMN 673) Is a medicine approved for use in patients with certain types of breast cancers.  WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  This study had 2 parts: a “Leading-inhibitor” part of the study and an “investigator-blinded” stage. A “lead-in-patient” is a person who was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone.  Lead-inpatient was a woman who had breast cancer with a specific gene mutation called “BRCA1” and was receiving treatment for that cancer at the time the study started.   The germline of the patient’s breast cancer was changed to be BRCA2.  (also known as “MBN673” or “BMN-601”.  ) T M G (  : n O  d e v o r p p This is a summary of the main results from this study.

Talazoparsib is also called BMN 673, MDV3800 or BMN-673. It is being tested in a large number of studies to see if it can help women with breast cancer to live longer and achieve a goal of survival longer when compared to other treatments.  Talazaparib has not been approved for use outside of research studies, because it is still being studied.  The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of talazoparamib in women with advanced breast cancer, compared to chemotherapy alone.    The study included women who: • Had breast cancer that had spread to the lungs or liver. • Had not responded to previous treatments for breast cancer with platinum. • Did not have a specific protein in the body that could be linked to the cancer cells. • Were unable to tolerate chemotherapy. • Could not tolerate a medicine containing platinum. The study started in 2012.  Ended in 2018.  1. General information about the patients who participated in this study and the results of the study is included in this summary.

Talazan works by interfering with these proteins, which helps to stop cancer cells from forming new cells. Talrazan is approved for the treatment of patients with certain types of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Talazaparib is not approved for use outside of research studies.  The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of Talazapan in patients with NSCLC.  To do this, we collected information on the patients who participated in the study and the results of the study.  1. General information about the patients included in this study is provided at the end of this summary. 2. When and where was the study done?  Study sites were in the basement of a home. The study started in September 2015 and ended in September 2016.  Why was the research needed? Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with a certain type of advanced NSL, called advanced ewing sarcoma (ESO). ESO is a type of cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and is difficult to treat. There are treatments that can be used to shrink ESO, but these treatments may not work well for all patients. There was a need to find new treatments for ESO-positive patients with advanced NSO.  Researchers did this study to find out if patients who received Talazopusinib had an improvement in their cancer after treatment with this medicine.  What were the main questions the study helped answer?  Did the patients’ cancer shrink after treatment?  Yes. Overall, the study results showed that the percentage of patients whose cancer shrunk after treatment was reduced by at least 30% compared to their cancer at the start of study was the same in both the treatment group and the control group. This was also true for the study group. What medical problems did the patients have during the study?  There were 2.5% of patients who had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug during this study. These were the most common medical problems among patients who took part in the trial.  More details about these results are included later in this summary, when they are available.

Clinical Trial Results 2013-003400 (CTR) 1.0.1.2. Who took part in the clinical study?  Talazoparib is a monoclonal antibody used to treat patients with certain types of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It works by interfering with the activity of certain proteins in the immune system, which leads to the body rejecting cancer cells.   Talazoparsib is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC who have received prior therapy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Talazaparib has not been approved for use in patients with other types of nsCLC because it is still being studied.  The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of talazaparinib in patients    in patients who have advanced nsCLCLC.  to find out if it works and about the side effects patients may have after taking it.  1  1 2  : n O   d e v o r p p A \\ d e The study included patients who had received chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their NSCLc and planned to receive talazuparinib.  9 1 e 7 7 1 0 9 0 2 0 2 - n a d e 7 1 9 1 0 2  9 0 3 0 4 0 9 e 8 1 0 5 9 0 Researchers wanted to know: n O d e did patients have any medical problems during the study? r p A d e WHAT HAPPENEDUCATION: did patients who received talazoparin have any unwanted medical events during the course of the study, and were found to have any of the following medical events? p p This study included adult patients who were taking chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or radiation  9 e chemotherapy for their cancer.  d a total of 35 patients.  : 9 1 9 0 1 0 3 9 0  1 e 9 0 : n o  d b e Patients were in the study for up to 42.8 months.

The main goal of the study was to learn more about the use of talazopharma in patients with NSCLc.  Talazofibers are a new class of cancer treatments that are being tested for the prevention of cancer cells from multiplying and spreading.  They work by blocking a protein called “Programmed Death-1 (Pdf) 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, and stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping the activity of certain proteins in the body’s defense and/resistance genes, which stops the growth and spread of cancer cell types.  )   1   2   3 1  1 2  : n O  d e The mainstay of this treatment is called palliative chemotherapy, which is a therapy for patients with cancer.  1 e The standard of care for patients who are treated with chemotherapy is supportive care, which includes regular check-up and follow-up visits, as well as regular laboratory exams and laboratory tests.  n O d e screening of patients for any potential side effects.  : d e v o r p A \\ d e 7 1  9 1 e 7 7 1 0 9 0 2 WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?   This study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients taking talazofibanib had an improvement in vital signs and other signs and symptoms compared to patients who were treated with palliotherapy alone. The study included patients who:  Were at least 18 years old and had a confirmed stage 4 or 5 nsCLC (low level of pdf ) at the time of study start. � Had received at least one dose of palliatorib in the last 6 months before starting the study.  d � Talazoparib is a prescription medicine for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It works by interfering with the connections between the body’s immune system and the rest of the body.  Talazoparsib is approved to treat patients with NSCLC using a small molecule called pembrolizumab.    The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of talazoparmib in patients with nsCLC.  Researchers wanted to know:  How long did it take for patients to have a change in their quality of life (QOL) and functional status after they started taking the medicine?   What medical problems did these patients have during the study?  What were the results of the study for the patients who took talazuparib?  All of the patients in this study had a physical exam, physical examination, and a follow-up physical exam at the end of the first cycle of treatment. All of these exams were done at the same time each day.  The patients were also asked to complete the eORTC-QLQ-C30 (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer) quality of Life Questionnaire (Qol-Q30).  The purpose of the QOL was to assess the patients’ overall health and quality of their lives. The main aim of the research study  was to find out if the patients had a decrease in their overall health status after taking the study medicine for at least 42.8 months. The study also looked for any medical problems that the patients may have had during this study.  ) T M G (  1 0  0 2 0  : n O  d e v o r p p A \\ d e The study included adult patients who were diagnosed with nsclc.  1 2 0 2 9 1 e 7 7 1 0 9 0 2 - 9 0 1 0 3 9 0 0 2 n a 9 0   9 0 3 0 2 e 7 6 0 9 1 0 2  0 4 0 9 2 0 5 9 0 e 8 1 0 0  3 0  f b e 9 0 f 1 e 8 0 f b 1 0 f 3 0 f 9 0 c e 6 0  9 1 f 9 1 c e 7 1 e 9 1 1 0 10 0 2 WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?

What was the purpose of this study?  breast cancer is the most common cancer in women.  Breast cancer can grow in almost any body cavity.  The amount of cancer cells in the blood is measured by the number of red blood cells in a person’s blood. Red blood cells are part of the body defense system.  Red blood cell counts are used to fight cancer. Red cells help fight cancer cells by helping the body fight off other types of cancer. Some types of breast cancers have red blood cell count abnormalities, which can lead to cancer growth and spread.  Talazoparsib is an oral medicine that is used to treat breast cancer and is approved for use in women to treat some types of non-melanoma (non-small cell lung cancer).   breast cancers that have spread beyond the original tumor to surrounding tissues.  [ 2 ]   Researchers wanted to know more about the use of talazoparinib in women with breast cancer to treat metastatic cancer. They also wanted to learn more about its safety.   What were the main results of the study? )   The main goals of the this study were to find out:   Serious adverse events (adverse events) that the participants had during the study.  Overall, the most of the participants who had serious adverse events had at least one of the following: Talazuparib 1. Talazopharmaceutical side effects. Talrazepam (also had serious side effects that the participant had more than one of these events.  • The most of these side effects were related to the study drug.  (Talazopharma, inc. ) Talazioparib had 2 main goals: • To reduce the amount of blood red cells in participants’ blood. • To decrease the number and spread of cancer in participants who were given the study medicine. \n",
      " • To prevent cancer cells from spreading to surrounding organs.  To reduce cancer cells.  Patients who were previously treated with platinum (a type of chemotherapy that kills cancer cells) received treatment with talazioparamitavir (also known as gemcitabine) for their breast cancer in the form of a radioisotope inhibitor.  Platinum is a type of platinum used to destroy cancer cells Talazoparibis is a new type of hematopoietic stem cell inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with certain types of anaemia due to malignancy.    1   2   What are the side effects of Talazoparsinib?

      " WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE? Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer in women. In 2012, around 1.7 million women were diagnosed with this disease around the world. Men can also get breast cancer, though this is quite rare.  Some breast cancers are caused by “mutations” in “DNA” in the BReast CAncer “genes” 1 and 2, which are more commonly known as BRCA1 and BRCA2. DNA is a material inside the cells of all living things that controls how cells in the body grow.  Genes are parts of DNA that contain the code for a specific feature, like eye color.  Mutations are changes in the DNA that can alter how a cell will behave.  If the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have mutations then this may cause breast cancer.  These mutations can be inherited from a parent with this mutation or through chance, which is like the roll of a dice. Special proteins known as “poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase” or “PARP” are found in all cells, and these proteins can help damaged cells fix or repair themselves so that the cell survives. When PARP helps cancer cells fix or repair themselves, it means that the cancer cell (and the tumor it is part of) can continue to grow and spread.  Talazoparib is a “PARP inhibitor,” which means it is a drug that can help stop the normal activity of PARP. At the time of this study, talazoparib was an “investigational drug”. An investigational drug means that the treatment has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or other regulatory agencies. This study was carried out to see if talazoparib could help reduce tumor size and slow growth in people with advanced breast cancer who have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes from a parent.  On 16 October 2018, talazoparib received approval from the FDA for use in some people with breast cancer. While this study was taking place, the sponsor decided it was better to recruit patients into a Phase 3 study that compared talazoparib with usual treatment for breast cancer rather than enroll patients into this study. This study was stopped early on 31 October 2018, and the sponsor transferred patients who were still being treated with talazoparib into another study.     2  WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  All patients in this study received talazoparib. The researchers wanted to find out if a patient’s previous breast cancer treatment could change the way talazoparib was able to treat the tumor. Some patients with cancer are given chemotherapy with drugs containing platinum while others are given chemotherapy with drugs that do not contain platinum. This study included 2 different groups of patients previously treated for breast cancer as shown in the table below. The patients in both of these groups had breast cancer that was advanced and difficult to treat.  Description of Treatment Groups Number of Group Previous Treatment for Breast Cancer Patients Treateda 1 Prior chemotherapy with drugs containing platinum 48b (platinum-based therapy) like cisplatin or carboplatin.  Patients initially responded to treatment, and while the cancer came back, this occurred more than 8 weeks after last dose of platinum-therapy 2 Prior chemotherapy with 3 or more courses of 35 treatment with drugs like docetaxel, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin that are not based on a platinum drug.  Note: Use of a platinum-based therapy before or after surgery was allowed providing the cancer did not return within 6 months of the last platinum dose a 84 patients originally joined this study, but 1 patient left before receiving treatment and only 83 patients were treated with talazoparib b This group originally contained 49 patients as it included the patient who left the study before receiving talazoparib.   The study included patients who: • Were 18 years or older • Had breast cancer that was advanced and not suitable for radiotherapy or surgery or had “metastatic disease”, which is when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body • Inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation   3    Patients joined the study at 1 of 34 sites in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany, and Spain. The study began on 13 December 2013 when the first patient had their first visit. All patients were aged between 31 years and 75 years, and nearly all were women. There were 2 men treated in the study, with 1 in each group. There were originally 84 patients who joined the study, but 1 patient left before receiving treatment with talazoparib. A total of 83 patients were treated with talazoparib in this study until their doctor determined their cancer was getting worse, the side effects were too severe, the patient decided they wanted to leave the study, or the study was closed by the Sponsor. The main reason patients treated with talazoparib left the study was because they passed away (81%, or 67 out of the 83 treated patients).   4  As of 01 September 2016 (the data cutoff date for the full report), 10 patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (21%, or 10 out of the 48 treated patients) and 16 patients from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (46%, or 16 out of the 35 treated patients) were still in the study but were “off-treatment” and not taking talazoparib.  In addition, 5 patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (10%, or 5 out of 48 treated patients) and 4 patients from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (11%, or 4 out of 35 treated patients) were “on-treatment” and taking talazoparib.  These on-treatment patients were followed until 31 October 2018, when the study was closed early by the Sponsor. At the time the study ended, 2 out of these 9 patients were continuing to receive talazoparib treatment. As these 2 patients were benefitting from talazoparib, the Sponsor transferred them into another study so they could continue this treatment.  Data collected up to 01 September 2017 were reviewed by the Sponsor and used to write a report. This is a summary of the information included in the report on how talazoparib was able to treat breast cancer. Data collected up until 31 October 2018, when the Sponsor closed the study, were analyzed in a supplementary safety report.  The main findings of the safety report are summarized in this document. WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? Did taking talazoparib help tumors disappear or shrink?  Researchers looked at the “objective response rate,” which is whether tumors disappeared (eg, “complete response”) or shrunk (eg, “partial response”) after taking talazoparib. Overall, 23 patients had a tumor that disappeared or shrunk (28%, or 23 out of the 83 treated patients). This included patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (21%, or 10 out of the 48 treated patients) and also from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (37%, or 13 out of the 35 treated patients).    5   Did taking talazoparib help tumors disappear, shrink or stay the same for 24 weeks?  Researcher looked at whether tumors disappeared, shrunk or stayed the same (eg, “stable disease”) for 24 weeks, as this gives researchers an idea of the clinical benefit of talazoparib. Overall, 29 patients had clinical benefit from treatment at 24 weeks (35%, or 29 out of the 83 treated patients). This included patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (27%, or 13 out of the 48 treated patients) and patients from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (46%, or 16 out of the 35 treated patients).   How long did patients taking talazoparib continue to respond to this treatment? Researchers measured how long it took for the tumor to come back after it had disappeared and the time it took for the tumor to start to grow again after it had shrunk. The researchers took the results (in the number of months) and put them in order from the smallest to the largest. They then looked at the middle number, or the “median”, to help them answer this question. There was a median of almost 4 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based  6  chemotherapy and a median of almost 6 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs.   How long did patients go without their cancer getting any worse after taking talazoparib? Researchers measured how long patients went without their cancer getting any worse after taking talazoparib. There was a median of 4 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment and a median of 6 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs.   When researchers looked at the time before patients passed away, this was a median of 12 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment and a median of 17 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs. This included data collected up until 01 September 2016. As the sponsor had access to data up to 07 April 2017, they used this to look again at the time before patients passed away.  This date of 07 April 2017 is likely to give a more accurate result. This was a median of 13 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based  7  treatment and a median of 15 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs.  Based on these results, the researchers thought talazoparib may be 1 of the options available to doctors who are treating patients with breast cancer who have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. This includes patients previously treated with platinum-based treatment as well as patients previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs. This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. Other studies may produce different results as well. These are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.  WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY? The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study.  Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an investigational drug might be.    8  A total of 81 out of the 83 treated patients in this study had at least 1 “non-serious” medical problem. A “serious” medical problem is a medical problem that is life threatening, needs hospital care, or cause lasting problems. Overall, 5 patients left the study because of medical problems (6%, or 5 out of the 83 treated patients). This included 4 patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (8%, 4 out of the 48 treated patients) and 1 patient from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (3%, 1 out of the 35 treated patients). The most common medical problems experienced by patients in this study are listed in the following table, and these were most often in the digestive system (stomach and intestines), were general like tiredness, or were seen in blood test results. Medical problems were also seen in other areas of the body and affected the heart, eyes, brain, or blood system. While overall more than 1 in 10 patients had some type of problem that affected these areas of the body, none of the individual medical problems in these areas were seen in more than 1 in 10 patients.  Most Common Medical Problems  (Reported by at Least 10% of Patients in Either Group) Previously Treated with 3 or More Prior Platinum-based Chemotherapy Medical Problem Chemotherapy Courses with (48 Patients Treated) Non-platinum Drugs (35 Patients Treated) Feeling tired 29 (60%) 8 (23%) Low red blood cell count 24 (50%) 19 (54%) (anemia) Upset stomach or feeling sick 20 (42%) 15 (43%) Diarrhea or loose stools 18 (38%) 10 (29%) Low platelets (or small bits of 18 (38%) 9 (26%) cells in the blood) Low numbers of neutrophils  10 (21%) 12 (34%) (a type of white blood cell)  9  Previously Treated with 3 or More Prior Platinum-based Chemotherapy Medical Problem Chemotherapy Courses with (48 Patients Treated) Non-platinum Drugs (35 Patients Treated) Headache 9 (19%) 11 (31%) Feeling weak 3 (6%) 10 (29%) Not feeling hungry 12 (25%) 10 (29%) Joint pains 8 (17%) 9 (26%) Being out of breath 11 (23%) 9 (26%) Back pain 12 (25%) 8 (23%) Viral chest infection 11 (23%) 3 (9%) Hair loss (baldness) 11 (23%) 6 (17%) Vomiting or being sick  10 (21%) 8 (23%) Stomach pain 7 (15%) 7 (20%) Cough 9 (19%) 7 (20%) Constipation 9 (19%) 6 (17%) Low numbers of leukocytes (a 7 (15%) 6 (17%) type of white blood cell) Low platelet count  7 (15%) 5 (14%) (from blood test) Low neutrophil count  5 (10%) 5 (14%) (from blood test) Muscle spasms 4 (8%) 5 (14%)   10  WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS? A total of 69 patients (83%, or 69 out of the 83 treated patients) passed away while in this study, and almost all of these deaths were due to the cancer coming back or getting worse. Other serious medical problems were seen in 16 patients in the group previously treated with prior platinum-based treatment (33%, or 16 out of the 48 treated patients) and 7 patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (20%, or 7 out of the 35 treated patients). These serious medical problems mainly affected the blood (eg, low levels of red blood cells or “platelets” or small bits of cells), the lungs or were because of the  cancer.
