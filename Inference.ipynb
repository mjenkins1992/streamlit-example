      " WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE? Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer in women. In 2012, around 1.7 million women were diagnosed with this disease around the world. Men can also get breast cancer, though this is quite rare.  Some breast cancers are caused by “mutations” in “DNA” in the BReast CAncer “genes” 1 and 2, which are more commonly known as BRCA1 and BRCA2. DNA is a material inside the cells of all living things that controls how cells in the body grow.  Genes are parts of DNA that contain the code for a specific feature, like eye color.  Mutations are changes in the DNA that can alter how a cell will behave.  If the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have mutations then this may cause breast cancer.  These mutations can be inherited from a parent with this mutation or through chance, which is like the roll of a dice. Special proteins known as “poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase” or “PARP” are found in all cells, and these proteins can help damaged cells fix or repair themselves so that the cell survives. When PARP helps cancer cells fix or repair themselves, it means that the cancer cell (and the tumor it is part of) can continue to grow and spread.  Talazoparib is a “PARP inhibitor,” which means it is a drug that can help stop the normal activity of PARP. At the time of this study, talazoparib was an “investigational drug”. An investigational drug means that the treatment has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or other regulatory agencies. This study was carried out to see if talazoparib could help reduce tumor size and slow growth in people with advanced breast cancer who have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes from a parent.  On 16 October 2018, talazoparib received approval from the FDA for use in some people with breast cancer. While this study was taking place, the sponsor decided it was better to recruit patients into a Phase 3 study that compared talazoparib with usual treatment for breast cancer rather than enroll patients into this study. This study was stopped early on 31 October 2018, and the sponsor transferred patients who were still being treated with talazoparib into another study.     2  WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  All patients in this study received talazoparib. The researchers wanted to find out if a patient’s previous breast cancer treatment could change the way talazoparib was able to treat the tumor. Some patients with cancer are given chemotherapy with drugs containing platinum while others are given chemotherapy with drugs that do not contain platinum. This study included 2 different groups of patients previously treated for breast cancer as shown in the table below. The patients in both of these groups had breast cancer that was advanced and difficult to treat.  Description of Treatment Groups Number of Group Previous Treatment for Breast Cancer Patients Treateda 1 Prior chemotherapy with drugs containing platinum 48b (platinum-based therapy) like cisplatin or carboplatin.  Patients initially responded to treatment, and while the cancer came back, this occurred more than 8 weeks after last dose of platinum-therapy 2 Prior chemotherapy with 3 or more courses of 35 treatment with drugs like docetaxel, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin that are not based on a platinum drug.  Note: Use of a platinum-based therapy before or after surgery was allowed providing the cancer did not return within 6 months of the last platinum dose a 84 patients originally joined this study, but 1 patient left before receiving treatment and only 83 patients were treated with talazoparib b This group originally contained 49 patients as it included the patient who left the study before receiving talazoparib.   The study included patients who: • Were 18 years or older • Had breast cancer that was advanced and not suitable for radiotherapy or surgery or had “metastatic disease”, which is when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body • Inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation   3    Patients joined the study at 1 of 34 sites in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany, and Spain. The study began on 13 December 2013 when the first patient had their first visit. All patients were aged between 31 years and 75 years, and nearly all were women. There were 2 men treated in the study, with 1 in each group. There were originally 84 patients who joined the study, but 1 patient left before receiving treatment with talazoparib. A total of 83 patients were treated with talazoparib in this study until their doctor determined their cancer was getting worse, the side effects were too severe, the patient decided they wanted to leave the study, or the study was closed by the Sponsor. The main reason patients treated with talazoparib left the study was because they passed away (81%, or 67 out of the 83 treated patients).   4  As of 01 September 2016 (the data cutoff date for the full report), 10 patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (21%, or 10 out of the 48 treated patients) and 16 patients from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (46%, or 16 out of the 35 treated patients) were still in the study but were “off-treatment” and not taking talazoparib.  In addition, 5 patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (10%, or 5 out of 48 treated patients) and 4 patients from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (11%, or 4 out of 35 treated patients) were “on-treatment” and taking talazoparib.  These on-treatment patients were followed until 31 October 2018, when the study was closed early by the Sponsor. At the time the study ended, 2 out of these 9 patients were continuing to receive talazoparib treatment. As these 2 patients were benefitting from talazoparib, the Sponsor transferred them into another study so they could continue this treatment.  Data collected up to 01 September 2017 were reviewed by the Sponsor and used to write a report. This is a summary of the information included in the report on how talazoparib was able to treat breast cancer. Data collected up until 31 October 2018, when the Sponsor closed the study, were analyzed in a supplementary safety report.  The main findings of the safety report are summarized in this document. WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? Did taking talazoparib help tumors disappear or shrink?  Researchers looked at the “objective response rate,” which is whether tumors disappeared (eg, “complete response”) or shrunk (eg, “partial response”) after taking talazoparib. Overall, 23 patients had a tumor that disappeared or shrunk (28%, or 23 out of the 83 treated patients). This included patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (21%, or 10 out of the 48 treated patients) and also from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (37%, or 13 out of the 35 treated patients).    5   Did taking talazoparib help tumors disappear, shrink or stay the same for 24 weeks?  Researcher looked at whether tumors disappeared, shrunk or stayed the same (eg, “stable disease”) for 24 weeks, as this gives researchers an idea of the clinical benefit of talazoparib. Overall, 29 patients had clinical benefit from treatment at 24 weeks (35%, or 29 out of the 83 treated patients). This included patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (27%, or 13 out of the 48 treated patients) and patients from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (46%, or 16 out of the 35 treated patients).   How long did patients taking talazoparib continue to respond to this treatment? Researchers measured how long it took for the tumor to come back after it had disappeared and the time it took for the tumor to start to grow again after it had shrunk. The researchers took the results (in the number of months) and put them in order from the smallest to the largest. They then looked at the middle number, or the “median”, to help them answer this question. There was a median of almost 4 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based  6  chemotherapy and a median of almost 6 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs.   How long did patients go without their cancer getting any worse after taking talazoparib? Researchers measured how long patients went without their cancer getting any worse after taking talazoparib. There was a median of 4 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment and a median of 6 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs.   When researchers looked at the time before patients passed away, this was a median of 12 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment and a median of 17 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs. This included data collected up until 01 September 2016. As the sponsor had access to data up to 07 April 2017, they used this to look again at the time before patients passed away.  This date of 07 April 2017 is likely to give a more accurate result. This was a median of 13 months for patients in the group previously treated with platinum-based  7  treatment and a median of 15 months for patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs.  Based on these results, the researchers thought talazoparib may be 1 of the options available to doctors who are treating patients with breast cancer who have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. This includes patients previously treated with platinum-based treatment as well as patients previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs. This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. Other studies may produce different results as well. These are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.  WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS HAVE DURING THE STUDY? The researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study.  Patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. By comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an investigational drug might be.    8  A total of 81 out of the 83 treated patients in this study had at least 1 “non-serious” medical problem. A “serious” medical problem is a medical problem that is life threatening, needs hospital care, or cause lasting problems. Overall, 5 patients left the study because of medical problems (6%, or 5 out of the 83 treated patients). This included 4 patients from the group previously treated with platinum-based treatment (8%, 4 out of the 48 treated patients) and 1 patient from the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (3%, 1 out of the 35 treated patients). The most common medical problems experienced by patients in this study are listed in the following table, and these were most often in the digestive system (stomach and intestines), were general like tiredness, or were seen in blood test results. Medical problems were also seen in other areas of the body and affected the heart, eyes, brain, or blood system. While overall more than 1 in 10 patients had some type of problem that affected these areas of the body, none of the individual medical problems in these areas were seen in more than 1 in 10 patients.  Most Common Medical Problems  (Reported by at Least 10% of Patients in Either Group) Previously Treated with 3 or More Prior Platinum-based Chemotherapy Medical Problem Chemotherapy Courses with (48 Patients Treated) Non-platinum Drugs (35 Patients Treated) Feeling tired 29 (60%) 8 (23%) Low red blood cell count 24 (50%) 19 (54%) (anemia) Upset stomach or feeling sick 20 (42%) 15 (43%) Diarrhea or loose stools 18 (38%) 10 (29%) Low platelets (or small bits of 18 (38%) 9 (26%) cells in the blood) Low numbers of neutrophils  10 (21%) 12 (34%) (a type of white blood cell)  9  Previously Treated with 3 or More Prior Platinum-based Chemotherapy Medical Problem Chemotherapy Courses with (48 Patients Treated) Non-platinum Drugs (35 Patients Treated) Headache 9 (19%) 11 (31%) Feeling weak 3 (6%) 10 (29%) Not feeling hungry 12 (25%) 10 (29%) Joint pains 8 (17%) 9 (26%) Being out of breath 11 (23%) 9 (26%) Back pain 12 (25%) 8 (23%) Viral chest infection 11 (23%) 3 (9%) Hair loss (baldness) 11 (23%) 6 (17%) Vomiting or being sick  10 (21%) 8 (23%) Stomach pain 7 (15%) 7 (20%) Cough 9 (19%) 7 (20%) Constipation 9 (19%) 6 (17%) Low numbers of leukocytes (a 7 (15%) 6 (17%) type of white blood cell) Low platelet count  7 (15%) 5 (14%) (from blood test) Low neutrophil count  5 (10%) 5 (14%) (from blood test) Muscle spasms 4 (8%) 5 (14%)   10  WERE THERE ANY SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS? A total of 69 patients (83%, or 69 out of the 83 treated patients) passed away while in this study, and almost all of these deaths were due to the cancer coming back or getting worse. Other serious medical problems were seen in 16 patients in the group previously treated with prior platinum-based treatment (33%, or 16 out of the 48 treated patients) and 7 patients in the group previously treated with 3 or more chemotherapy courses with non-platinum drugs (20%, or 7 out of the 35 treated patients). These serious medical problems mainly affected the blood (eg, low levels of red blood cells or “platelets” or small bits of cells), the lungs or were because of the  cancer.

No Notes: General information about the trial Main objective of the trial: The main objectives of this trail were to compare the efficacy of tofacitinib at doses of 5 mg twice daily (BID) and 10 mg BID versus placebo for the treatment of rheumatological signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), to compare physical function status, and to compare the safety and tolerability of 2 doses (5 mg BID and 10 mg BID) of tofacitinib versus placebo in participants with active PsA who have had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs. Protection of trial subjects: This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of trial participants. The final protocol and any amendments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board(s) and/or Independent Ethics Committee(s) at each of the investigational centres participating in the study. Background therapy: Eligible participants remained on a stable dose of 1 conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti'"

       "'WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE? Psoriatic arthritis (also known as “PsA”) is a disease that can cause pain and swelling (inflammation) in or around the joints, tendon areas, fingers, toes, and back, and is often combined with itchy, scaly rashes on the skin. These problems are because the immune system, whose job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs, mistakenly attacks other parts of the body instead.  If PsA inflammation is left untreated, joints, tendon areas, fingers, and toes may become painful or swollen; skin rashes may occur; and people may become extremely tired. There is no cure for PsA at this time, but common treatments for PsA include medicines that control pain, reduce inflammation, and prevent the immune system from attacking the joints. Tofacitinib is a medicine that may reduce the activity of the immune system. It is an ) oral (taken by mouth) medication used to treat adults with PsA. In this study, T M researchers wanted to learn more about the use of tofacitinib in people who had not G (  been helped by conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 5 2 7: (csDMARDs) like methotrexate, which were being used to treat PsA.  0  0 2 0 Researchers did this study to find out if tofactinib, when compared to placebo, in 2 - n patients on background therapy of csDMARD, reduced PsA symptoms and improved a J - a patient’s ability to perform physical activities (improved physical functioning).  8 2  Researchers wanted to answer this question:  : n O  d e \\uf0b7 Does tofacitinib help reduce pain, inflammation, and other symptoms caused v o by PsA in patients that were not helped by other drugs (csDMARDs) r p p A previously being used to treat PsA? \\\\ d e v o r p WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY? p A \\\\ 6 7 1 2 This study compared 5 groups of patients to find out if patients who took tofacitinib 9 a 2 had an improvement in PsA symptoms and physical functioning, compared to 9 1 e patients who took placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just 7 7 like the medicine being tested. Using a placebo helps researchers learn if the study 1 0 9 0 2 drug works better than no treatment at all. In this study, all patients (including those taking placebo) received 1 csDMARD as background therapy; thus, patients taking placebo did take some medicine in this study. Background therapy is the standard treatment routinely used to treat a disease or condition. In this study, some patients were given adalimumab, which is a medication that is used to treat PsA. Adalimumab is a biologic DMARD (bDMARD) and has been shown to reduce pain and inflammation in patients with PsA.  Researchers also wanted to find out if patients who took adalimumab, an active control, had an improvement in the same symptoms and functioning compared to patients who took placebo. An active control is a drug that is already being used to treat patients with the disease being studied. In this study, the active control was tested against placebo to see if the standard treatment available to patients worked better than no treatment at all. This study included adult men and women who: ) T M G \\uf0b7 Had active psoriatic arthritis for more than 6 months; (  5 2 \\uf0b7 Had active plaque psoriasis (skin lesions) that had been diagnosed or confirmed : 7 0 by a doctor;  0 2 0 \\uf0b7 Had 3 or more swollen joints and 3 or more tender (painful to the touch) 2 - n joints; a J - \\uf0b7 Were not helped by at least 1 csDMARD (like methotrexate) for the treatment 8 2 : of psoriatic arthritis. n O  d e All patients were taking a medication to treat their PsA that was prescribed by their v o r doctors before they entered the study. At the start of the study, these patients p p A continued to take the prescribed medication and were also assigned by chance alone \\\\ d e to receive some combination of tofacitinib, placebo, or adalimumab in 1 of 5 different v o r orders (treatment sequences). This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done p p A to make the groups more similar. Reducing differences between the groups (like age \\\\ 6 7 or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. 1 2 9 a This trial was also “double-blinded”. This means that patients and doctors did not 2 9 1 know who was given which treatment/medicine. This was done to make sure that the e 7 7 trial results were not influenced in any way. 1 0 9 0 3 The study had two parts: Part 1, which lasted for 3 months; and Part 2, which lasted for 9 months. Some patients received the same treatment in both parts of the study, but some patients received a different treatment in Part 2 than they received in Part 1.  Patients were randomized to receive some combination of tofacitinib, placebo, or adalimumab in 1 of 5 different sequences: Medicines Given in Each Treatment Sequence Treatment Sequence Part 1 (3 months) Part 2 (9 months) Tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) tablets A twice a day (BID) plus placebo Same as Part 1 injection once every 2 weeks Tofacitinib 10 mg tablets BID plus B Same as Part 1 placebo injection once every 2weeks Adalimumab injection (40 mg) once ) T M C every 2 weeks plus placebo tablets Same as Part 1 G ( BID  5 2 7: Placebo tablets BID plus placebo Tofacitinib 5 mg BID plus placebo 0 D  injection once every 2 weeks injection once every 2 weeks 0 2 0 2 Placebo tablets BID plus placebo Tofacitinib 10 mg BID plus placebo - E n a injection once every 2 weeks injection once every 2 weeks J - 8 2 All patients were required to receive 1 csDMARD(like methotrexate) during the study.  : n O  Patients were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study.

The Sponsor ran this study at 94 locations in Australia, Canada, 7 0  Mexico, Russian Federation, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and 0 2 0 throughout Europe. It began on 20 January 2014 and ended on 18 December 2015.  2 - n A total of 225 women (53%) and 197 men (47%) participated. All patients were a J - between the ages of 18 and 81 years. 8 2  : n O Patients were to be treated for 12 months. Of the 422 patients who started the study,  d e 373 (88%) finished the whole study.

Does tofacitinib reduce joint pain and inflammation in patients who were not helped by csDMARDs (like methotrexate)? Yes. In this study, tofacitinib reduced joint pain and inflammation in patients who were not helped by csDMARDs.  Researchers looked at the percentage of patients (number of patients out of 100) in each treatment group who had at least a 20% reduction in the number of joints that were tender/painful and swollen (inflamed) after 3 months of taking study drug.  They compared the number of tender/painful and swollen joints that patients had at the end of the 3 months of treatment to the number of tender/painful and swollen joints that patients had before they started the study, to see if tofacitinib reduced pain ) T M and inflammation. G (  5 More patients in both tofacitinib groups (5 mg and 10 mg) had less joint pain and 2 : 7 inflammation at the end of 3 months of treatment than patients in the placebo group. 0  0 2 Half of the patients taking 5 mg tofacitinib (50%; 5 out of every 10 patients) and over 0 2 half of the patients taking 10 mg tofacitinib (61%; 6 out of every 10 patients) had less - n a pain and inflammation than they had before they started treatment. One-third (33%) J - 8 2 of the patients taking placebo had a reduction in joint pain and inflammation  : n compared to their pain and inflammation before treatment.

They used a r p p questionnaire that asked patients to rate their level of difficulty completing an activity A \\\\ 6 on a scale ranging from “no difficulty completing activity” (a score of 0) to “unable to 7 1 2 complete activity” (a score of 3). Researchers then compared the patients’ responses 9 a after taking tofacitinib or placebo to their responses before they started study 2 9 1 treatment. e 7 7 1 0 9 0 7 On average, patients who took tofacitinib (5 mg and 10 mg) had a greater improvement in how easy it was to complete daily activities than patients taking placebo. At the end of 3 months of treatment, the questionnaire score (amount of difficulty completing activities) decreased by an average of 0.35 (out of 3) for patients who took tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 0.40 (out of 3) for patients who took tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, and 0.18 (out of 3) for patients who took placebo. Based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are /are not likely the result of chance. Tofacitinib may be an option for treating patients with PsA who were not previously helped by csDMARDs. This does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. Other studies may produce different results, as well. These are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.  ) T WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS M G ( HAVE DURING THE STUDY? 5 2 : 7 0  0 2 The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. 0 2 - Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for n a J example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance).

       "['WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE? A seizure is a sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can cause many different symptoms, such as shaking, loss of consciousness, or loss of control of body movements. A seizure occurs when the brain loses control of its normal electrical activity and begins to move around too fast or too slowly.  Pregabalin is an experimental drug that is being studied as an add-on treatment for partial onset seizures (positions) in children with epilepsy. Pregaban is used to treat partial onset epilepsy in children and teenagers. The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of pregabalin in reducing the frequency of these seizures in children who have never had a seizure before.  WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?  This study compared 2 groups of children to find out if a combination of Pregaba - nmentin (also known as no3AX16) and placebo (also called pradaxel®) would reduce the number of seizures in these children compared to placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being tested.  The study included children who were 1 month old to be less than 4 years old when the study started and who were taking 1 to 3 other antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy.   The children were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance (like tossing a coin) and received study medication.
