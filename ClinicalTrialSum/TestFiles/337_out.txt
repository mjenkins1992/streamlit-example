Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have kidney diseases caused by CMV. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is. What treatments did the participants take?   What were the results of this study? The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:  Did the participants who took ASP0113 have an increased chance of getting a kidney transplant?  What medical problems did theparticipants have during the study?  How was the study going? The researchers found that the study participants had more chances of gettinga kidney transplant compared to the participantswho took the placebo. 
 who took the other kidney disease treatment, called dialysis?  The researchers also found that kidney transplantation was the most common medical problem the participants had during the first year after taking the study drug.  What happened during the Study?  During the study, the researchers collected information about the participants’health and quality of life. The researchers used this information to create a report of the results. What happened in the study?   How did the researchers find out if the participants did?  To answer the questions the answers to these questions, the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions about their kidney disease and medical problems. The answers to the researchers found in the questionnaire were as follows:   Didthe participants have any medical problems during thestudy?  Yes. Overall, 146participants took part in thestudy.

Yes. Overall, it gets worse after 
kidney transplant surgery.
