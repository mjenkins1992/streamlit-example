General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
A Phase 3b, single arm, open-label, multicenter study in treatment naïve adults with chronic HCV
infection and compensated cirrhosis to assess the safety of 8 weeks of treatment with
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and to demonstrate the efficacy of the sustained virologic response 12 weeks
post dosing (SVR12) rates of 8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir compared to the
historical SVR12 rates of 12 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.

End point description:
SVR12 was defined as plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than the lower limit
of quantification (<LLOQ; less than 15 IU/mL) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Efficacy of the
8-week treatment duration compared to the historical 12-week treatment duration was demonstrated if
the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentage of participants with HCV
GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5, or GT6 infection in the 8 week treatment duration achieving SVR12 was greater
than 94% in the PP population. Efficacy analyses were performed following a fixed-sequence testing
procedure to control the type I error rate. The percentage of participants achieving SVR12 was
summarized with a 2-sided 95% CI, calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial
distribution. If the number of participants who failed to achieve SVR12 rate was less than 5, the Wilson's
score method was used to calculate the CI.

More information
Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
25 April 2017 This amendment clarified the protocol deviation process, specified that
participants experiencing virologic failure will be offered retreatment and excluded
participants with a medical history of solid organ transplantation.
06 September 2017 This amendment included an update to Primary Efficacy Endpoints, based on
regulatory authority feedback, the analysis of SVR12 based on the ITT population
has been elevated from a secondary to a primary efficacy endpoint , references to
non-inferiority have been removed, and the Wilson score method will be used to
calculate the confidence intervals for the primary efficacy endpoints if the number
of SVR12 non-responders is less than 5, clarification of pregnancy test
requirements during the study,include additional language on empiric use of
lactulose and rifaximin and to clarify the list of approved and investigational anti-
HCV compounds and that historical presence of HCC within the previous 5 years is
exclusionary,clarify that specific statins must be discontinued at least 14 days or
10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug, clarify
when study procedures to be performed, and clarify that the Physical Exam and
labs are to be drawn for FibroTest and Child-Pugh scores.
11 June 2018 Allow for the enrollment of participants infected with HCV Genotype 3 to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of an 8-week treatment regimen in a treatment-naïve
cirrhotic patient population inclusive of patients with HCV GT3 infection.  Update
prohibited therapy based on the marketing approval of GLE/PIB.
Notes:
Interruptions (globally)
Were there any global interruptions to the trial?  No
