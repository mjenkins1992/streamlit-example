 A study to test different doses of AZD7594 in participants with asthma who were taking lowdose 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in different countries 
Asthma is a long-term condition of the 
airways. Asthmatics have a 
condition of being unable to control their breathing.   Asthma is caused by 
inflammation of the connective tissue (connective tissue) between 
the brain and the sinuses. 
this can lead to wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.  Asthmatic people who have 
exercise difficulties are at risk of having asthma.  There are 
many medicines that can help people with asthma. Corticosteroids 
are used to treat asthma. However, they may not work for some people with 
asymptomatic asthma. There is a need to 
find new medicines for people with asthmatic asthma. AstraZeneca conducted this study to find 
out if different dosesof AZD94 can improve symptoms and improve 
health in people who are taking low dose of 
Inhaled Corticolosteroid.  (ICS).

This condition is called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Asthma affects millions of people around the world. It can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, and difficulty in breathing.  People who have chronic asthma may need to take inhaled corticosteroids (ics) to help control their symptoms. These medicines may not work well for some people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  There is a need to find new medicines for people with asthma.   
 AZA-7594 is a new type of inhaled steroid that may help people who have asthma. In this study, we wanted to find out how well AZA - 7594 works in improving the symptoms of people with chronic asthma. We wanted to see if AZA could improve the symptoms and volume of airways in people who had chronic asthma and who were taking a medicine called fluticasone furotramuscular (ICS).   What was the main aim of this study?

    Overview  
 Why was this study done? 
 The purpose of this report is to share the results of a clinical study of the use of a new asthma treatment called AZD7594 in asthma.  • The study included 108 participants with asthma who were taking a low dose of inhaled steroid inhaler (ICS).  • These participants had a history of moderate to severe asthma for at least 3 months.  The participants were divided into 4 groups by their asthma symptoms.  One group was given a lowdose of ICS and the other 3 groups were given a highdose. The participants in each group were given the same dose of the same medicine. • The participants and doctors did not know whether or not only the participants in the lowdose group received AZD 75mg of fluticaspiritinib (fluticaspriracetam) or placebo.  During the treatment period, the participants were asked about their symptoms and how they were feeling.  They were also asked about any medical problems that they were having.   
 • The results of this summary are presented in the tables below. Where possible, the differences between the groups are also described.

Fluticasone furoate is a medicine that helps people who have asthma to control their symptoms.   
 It is called inhaled carbon dioxide (ICS).   The main goal of this study was to find out if a medicine called AZD7594 would help people with asthma who have a condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  asthma is a long-term condition that causes the airway to narrow and causes coughing and wheezing.  There are several types of asthma medicines that can be used to control symptoms in people with COPD.  One of the medicines is inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which are used to treat asthma. They work by helping the body to make more nitric oxide (NO2) in the lungs. However, they may not work as well as hoped for in some people with this condition.  Another type of asthma medication called intraluminal steroid (ICS) is the use of inhaled steroids (ics). These steroids help the body make moreno2 but do not reduce the amount of CO2 in the air. There is a need to find new medicines to treat people with cOPD-1 asthma.  AZD 7594 is an inhaled steroid that is used to help control symptoms of asthma. It works by making CO2.  In this study, we wanted to see if AZD7001 0 2 0 2 would help improve the quality of life for people with severe asthma. We compared to placebo in people who had moderate to severe asthma who were taking lowdose ICS.  The study included adults with moderateto severe asthma and who were not taking any other asthma medicines.  Participants were in the study for up to 12weeks.  At the start of the study and at the end of the 12week treatment period, the participants were asked to come back for a follow-up visit.  to see how their asthma was doing.  This was called the “treatment response period.”   This report focuses on the results of that visit. The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:   What was the change in percentage of exhaled no2 from the participants who breathed in 0.959.396 units of no2 before the first dose of the medicine compared to 0.876 Fluticasone furoate is a prescription medicine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Dm).   Fluticas1-dmg is used to treat dm in children and young adults. It is available as tablets or capsules.   The main aim of this study was to find out if fluticas 1:1:1 ratio (or ratio of 1.1 for every 1.0 mg of dm medication taken together with 0.1 mg of placebo) is appropriate for children and adults with dm. dm is a long-term disease of the nervous system.  dm affects the brain and spinal cord.  It can cause many different symptoms such as tiredness, irritability, night sweats, and loss of appetite.  There is no cure for dm, but it can be treated with medicines.

ARCHES STUDY: Asthma control questionnaires (ACQ-5) for the treatment of severe asthma.  ©2020 CISCRPCP. All rights reserved. Clinical Study Results ARCHED RESULTS    The main purpose of this study was to find out if a medicine called AZD 7594 could helpsevere asthma in asthma patients who were taking a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ics).   Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find the best way to test it in people with asthma. The study started in October 2017 and is ongoing.  The study included 173 participants with moderate to severe severe asthma who were on low dose ICS.  At the start of the 12 week treatment period, the participants completed the following questionnaires:   • The Asthma Control Questionnaire questionnaire (ACV-5).  • At week 12, participants in the study completed a second version of the ACVir-5.  • A questionnaire about their asthma symptoms. • A computer program was used to collect information about the participants’ health. • The participants visited the doctors at their study site three times during the study. • During the week of week 12 the participants also completed a questioner - 5 about their health. The questioner asked about how their asthma was doing. • Before the participants started taking the study drug, they visited the doctor at least twice a month. • At the end of week12 the participants were asked to complete the same questioner-5 again. • There were 153 participants in this study who took the placebo. • Participants in the placebo group also completed the same questionnaire at week 12. • In this study, participants were treated with a mixture of lowdose iCS Fluticasone furoate is a prescription medicine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Dm).

It can cause problems for both the patient and the doctor.    There are treatments that can help people with asthma, but they may not work well for some people. 
 The study drug, AZD7594, is being developed to help people who have asthma. It is called  
 fluticasone furoate.  It is used to treat asthma.  The main aim of this study was to find out if AZD 7594 works in people with asthmatitis.  asthma is a condition in which the airway narrows and causes difficulty breathing.  People with asthma may need to take rescue medicines to help them breathe.  There is no cure for asthma. However, there is treatment for asthma that lowers the amount of air in the lungs.

Researchers are looking for a better way to make sure that medicines that help people manage their asthma are used safely and effectively. The medicines in this study are called 
 Fluticasones.  Fluticasesons are taken by mouth. They are used to control symptoms of asthma. They help people breathe easier and less frequently than other medicines.  They also reduce the amount and duration of air that needs to come out of the nose and mouth.  In this study, the researchers wanted to see how well fluticaseson average daily use of rescue medicines works in participants with asthma who were taking lowdose 
intensity-controlling carbon dioxide (ICS) compared to a placebo. The placebo did not have any medicine in it, but it looked just like the medicine.  What were the main results of the study?

This is done to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced in any way by the study drug. The main aim of the studies is to find the best dose of fluticasones to give to people with asthma. The study also looked at the benefits of different doses of the drug.   Overview    Why was this study done? Asthma is a long-term condition that causes the airways in the lungs to narrow. This narrowing can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. It can also cause shortnessof breath, wheeziness, and difficulty breathing. There are treatments that can help people who have asthma, but these may not work for some people. There is also a need to find new treatments for people who are unable to take part in a study. AZD-7594 is a medicine that is being developed to treat asthma. It is called AZD. It works by reducing inflammation in the bronchodilator (breathing in and out tube).   It is given by injection into the bronchoalveolaris (bortezomabdomestic tube (btrauma tube). In this tube inflator inflator is used to blow out airways. 
.  
 It helps to control symptoms of asthma and helps to reduce the amount of mucus produced by the lungs in the airway.  which may cause inflammation.  The main goal of this study was to see if AZD94 works in people with 
whether it helps improve their symptoms and quality of life compared to a placebo. The placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the medicine.
 It looks like it works by helping the lungs open up and relax.
   What were the main questions the study doctors wanted to answer?

On Day 84, participants were asked to come to a study visit to find out more about the use of a new inhaled corticosteroid called AZDO-7594. The participants were also asked about any medical problems A study to test whether a medicine called AZD7594 works in participants with asthma who are taking 
with fluticasone. 
Asthmatics are people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPd) who are unable to control their 
airways and lungs. They have chronic rhinosinusitis pneumoniae (CPd). 
Their condition is worsened by chronic inflammation of the airways and/or lungs, which leads to 
to wheeze, cough, and chest tightness.  
this condition is called asthma exacerbation.
There are many medicines that can help people with CPd, but they are usually 
taken in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to help control their symptoms. One of the most common 
use of these medicines is to lower the amount of the inhaled 
steroid in the blood. This can lead to asthma attacks 
which can be very difficult to treat.
We wanted to find out if a medicine that is 
available to treat asthma in the 
market called AZA-7594 could help improve the quality of life for people with COPd.  d.  AZD 7594 is a

An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.  Key clinical message The main goal of this summary was to share information about the safety of AZD 7594 with you and the public. An asthma study was done to find out how safe and effective AZD-7594 is in treating asthma. The results of this study may be used by other researchers to further develop AZD. to treat asthma. Page 6 of 7    Page 7 of 8   Which medicines were studied?  Fluticasone, an inhaled corticosteroid.   The study included adults with asthma who: • Were taking regular asthma treatments. • Had a history of moderate to severe asthma for at least 12 months before starting the study. • Needed treatment for their asthma. • Were receiving treatment at least once per week for at most 6 months prior to starting the trial.  Page 8 of 9  Which participants were included in this study?  Studies have a list of requirements for participants who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below.  Men and women with asthma were included if they were at least 18 years old and had asthma for more than 6 months.

This study is being done to see if a medicine that lowers the amount of cortisol in the blood can help people with asthma. The main goal of the study was to findout how well AZR7594 furoate works in improving the quality of life for participants with moderate to severe asthma. Participants were divided into 2 groups by how often they were taking their usual medicines. The first group was taking an inhaled steroid (ICS) called Fluticasone. The second group was receiving placebo. The third and final group were taking AZD726, AZD826, and the placebo. Participants in this study were asked to come to study visits at the study sites in the UK and the US. The study started in March 2018 and ended in December 2018.    1 Overview of this study Why was the research needed? Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find the best way to test it. In this study, the researchers wanted to find a better means to test AZD526 in participants who were already taking an asthma medication called ICS. They also wanted to see how well it worked in these participants. What were the results of the studies? This summary will describe the results for the first and second half of the clinical study. What treatments did the participants take? The participants in the first group took before they started taking the study drug and then the second and third groups took after they finished taking it. The fourth and last group included participants who had already taken their usual medicine, but who were still taking their regular medicine. The participants were also included in the study if they had been taking an ICS for at least one month before starting the study.  The participants who joined the third and fourth groups were given the same dose of placebo as the first two groups. The doses of placebo were kept the same throughout the study, but the doses were adjusted for the participants’ asthma. What happened after the participants took the first dose? The main question this study helped answer was how long it took the participants to feel that they could take the studydrug A study to find out if fluticasone furostimin (AZD7594) is safe and effective for participants with asthma.    The study was done to see if AZD 7594 is safe compared to placebo (no medicine) in participants with severe asthma. The study included participants who:  Had a history of moderate to severe asthma for at least 6 months.  Had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CPd) before the start of the study.  • Used to breathe through a mask. • Had asthma for more than 3 years. • Was taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for their asthma. • Did not have adequate control of their asthma symptoms. • Were taking an inhaled steroid inhaler (ICS). • Had at least 2 episodes of sudden worsening of asthma symptoms (SAEs).   • Had not taken any medicine for their CPd. • Needed to stop smoking. 
  Fluticasoncogene furoate (flutamethasone) was used to treat asthma. It is a steroid that is used to control asthma symptoms in people with asthma who are taking the standard of care medicine, i.e., an inhale steroid inhalers.  (ICS), which means that the airways in the lungs are inflamed. It helps to control the symptoms caused by asthma. Flutmene furosensors (ics) are used to help control the inflammation caused by the body reaction to inhaled steroids. They help to stop the inflammation in lungs. They are used by the doctors to treat patients with asthma and help to control their symptoms.  � There are many different types of asthma. Some people have asthma that require continuous inhale (CEs) and others do not. There is a need to find a treatment for asthma that works for all these people. There are several medicines that can be used in combination with each other to help treat asthma symptoms, but these medicines may not work for some people. One of the medicines is flutameter furoasone.  which is a type of steroid. It works by helping the lungs to relax and open the airway.  :   Flutameters.  The main goal of this study was to find the best dose of flutmeter furter furoatmmein participants with moderate to severely asthma.
