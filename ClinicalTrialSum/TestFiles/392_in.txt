General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
To evaluate the clinical efficacy of 2 doses of GSK2857916 in participants with relapsed/refractory
multiple myeloma
Protection of trial subjects:
In order to minimize corneal events associated with GSK2857916 prophylactic preservative-free artificial
tears should be administered in each eye at least 4 to 8 times daily beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1 until the
end of treatment. In the event of ocular symptoms (e.g., dry eyes), the use of artificial tears may be
increased up to every 2 hours as needed.
While not yet clinically demonstrated, it is theoretically possible that the application of a cooling eye
mask during GSK2857916 administration, and in the first few hours after infusion may subsequently
decrease ocular side effects. On the day of infusion at the discretion of the participant and the
investigator, the following may be considered:
• Beginning with the start of each GSK2857916 infusion, participants may apply cooling eye
masks to their eyes for approximately 1 hour or as much as tolerated.
• Participants may continue using the cooling eye mask beyond the first hour for up to 4 hours.
Further use beyond 4 hours is at the participant’s discretion.
Participants should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of blood
products, growth factors, and treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, antidiarrheal, and analgesics, as
appropriate. Concomitant therapy with bisphosphonates is allowed. Participants may receive local
irradiation for pain or stability control.

Blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose(Gl), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine
aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), total bilirubin(T.Bil), creatinine kinase (CK),
creatinine, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), potassium (Pot), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Sod),
phosphate (Ph) and urate. Grading was as per NCI-CTCAE version 4.03. Grade1: mild; Grade2:
moderate; Grade3: severe or medically significant; Grade4: life–threatening consequences. Baseline is
latest pre-dose assessment(Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. An increase
is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. 3 out of 221participants did not
receive any study treatment, were excluded from FSP. All the participants in the study were included in
the analysis (95, 99 and 24 Participants), but only those participants with data available at the specified

End point description:
Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including
unscheduled visits. Number of participants with shift in tear break-up time from >10 seconds (Baseline)
to <=5 seconds (worst post-Baseline) are presented. 3 participants out of 221 participants did not
receive any study treatment and thus, were excluded from the Full Safety Population. All the
participants in the study were included in the analysis (95, 99 and 24 Participants), but only those
participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the
category titles).

Serum samples were collected for the determination of anti-GSK2857916 antibodies (ADA) using a
validated electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay. The assay involved screening, confirmation and
titration steps. If serum samples tested positive in the screening assay, they were considered
'potentially positive' and were further analyzed for the specificity using the confirmation assay. Samples
that confirmed positive in the confirmation assay were reported as 'positive'. Confirmed positive ADA
samples were further characterized in the titration assay to quasi-quantitate the amount of ADA in the
sample. Additionally, confirmed positive ADA samples were also tested in a validated neutralizing
antibody assay to determine the potential neutralizing activity of the ADA. 3 participants out of 221

Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) overall composite score
End point title Worst change from Baseline in National Eye Institute Visual
Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) overall composite
score
End point description:
The NEI-VFQ-25 consisted of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions representing 11 vision-related
constructs, plus an additional single-item general health rating question to assess the impact of ocular
toxicity on visual function. Items were coded to a 0 to 100 scale and averaged to calculate domains.
Domain scores ranged from 0 to 100; higher scores are better. Therefore, increase in score means
improvement. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value,
including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from
the post-dose visit value. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented. 3 participants out of 221

their impact on vision-related functioning. The total OSDI score was calculated as (sum of scores for all
questions answered*100) divided by (total number of questions answered*4). Domain scores ranged
from 0 to 100; lower scores are better. Therefore, decrease in score from Baseline means improvement.
Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including
unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-

Secondary: Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ 20-item multiple myeloma module
(MY20) score
End point title Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ 20-item multiple myeloma
module (MY20) score
End point description:
The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple
myeloma. The module comprised of 20 questions that addressed four myeloma-specific HRQoL domains:
disease symptoms (DS), side effects of treatment (SET), future perspective (FP) and body image (BI).
Responses are 1 to 4. Scores were averaged and scales were transformed to 0 to 100 scale.  A high
score for disease symptoms and side effects of treatment represented a high level of symptomatology or
problems, whereas a high score for future perspective and body image represented better outcomes.
Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including
unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-
dose visit value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed
(represented by n=X in the category titles). 99999 indicates the data is not available.

Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
02 April 2018 Amendment 01: Addressed regulatory agency advice. The original single-arm
design with 1 dose level (3.4 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg] GSK2857916 once
every 3 weeks [Q3W]) was amended to an open label, randomized, 2-arm study
with 2 dose levels by including the 2.5 mg/kg Q3W dose.  In addition, a new
exploratory cohort of 25 participants, who will receive a lyophilized configuration
of GSK2857916, was added to gain clinical experience with the lyophilized
configuration.  To accommodate these main changes, the overall sample size and
related analytical methods were changed.
30 August 2018 Amendment 02: Addressed feedback from regulatory agencies, ethics
commitee/institutional review board, and investigators. The updates included the
addition of Exclusion Criteria defining the use of high dose steroids, clarification of
specific timeframe from last treatment required for systemic anti-myeloma
therapy, and increase of corrected QT interval Fridericia criteria.  Additional
pharmacokinetic sampling timepoints were added to capture the maximum
observed concentration of the free cytotoxic drug (cysteine-maleimidocaproyl
monomethyl auristatin F [cys-mcMMAF]) and to better define the kinetics of cys-
mcMMAF and the elimination phase of antibody drug conjugate and cys-mcMMAF.
Soluble B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) collection timepoints were also added to
capture the effect of GSK2857916 administration on soluble BCMA concentrations
over time as a marker of pharmacodynamic effect.  The dose modifications
guidelines for GSK2857916 related Corneal Events clarified dose adjustments for
GlaxoSmithKline Scale Grade 2 events.
17 December 2018 Amendment 03:   Addressed over-enrolment in the frozen liquid solution portion
of the study. Due to the over-enrolment, the primary analysis will be based on all
randomized participants (anticipated approximately 200) enroled into the frozen
