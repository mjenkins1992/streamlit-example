Notes:
General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
The overall purpose of the trial was to evaluate efficacy and safety of tiotropium inhalation solution
delivered via Respimat® inhaler (2.5 μg and 5 μg once daily in the evening) over 48 weeks, compared
to placebo, in children (6 to 11 years old) with moderate persistent asthma. The primary objective of the
trial was to demonstrate superiority of tiotropium (5 μg and possibly 2.5 μg once daily in the evening)
over placebo with regard to the primary pulmonary function endpoint after 24 weeks of treatment.
Secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy of tiotropium with regard to other efficacy endpoints
after 24 and 48 week of treatment, and to evaluate the long-term safety of tiotropium of a 48 week
treatment, compared to placebo, as add-on controller therapy on top of usual care in this patient
population.
Protection of trial subjects:
Only subjects that met all the study inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were to be entered in
the study. All subjects were free to withdraw from the clinical trial at any time for any reason given.
Close monitoring of all subjects was adhered to throughout the trial conduct. Salbutamol (albuterol) was
provided as rescue medication for use as necessary during the trial.

Recruitment details: -
Pre-assignment
Screening details:
All subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites
which would then ensure that they (the subjects) met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion
criteria. Subjects were not to be randomised to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria
were violated.

End point description:
Change from baseline of area under the curve (AUC) from 0 to 3 hours for FVC (Forced vital capacity)
(FVC AUC (0-3h)) after 24 weeks of treatment. The AUC was calculated by using the trapezoidal rule
divided by the observation time (3h).

End point title PAQLQ(S) total score
End point description:
Standardised Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ(S)) total score at weeks 24 and
48.
The PAQLQ(S) is 23 questions on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (worst control) to 7 (best control).
Total Score is calculated as mean of all 23 questions.
The measured values presented are actually adjusted means.
The number of participants analysed displays the number of participants included in the statistical model
whereas the N’s for each timepoint display the number of participants with available data at that
timepoint.
Missing data at a visit was imputed by the available data from the patient at that visit. Completely
missing data were handled by the statistical
model.

More information
Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
21 March 2013 This amendment introduced changes to clarify wording and trial procedures, to
replace the name and contact information of the former CI with the name and
contact information of the new CI, to correct minor typographical errors and
inconsistencies, and to update the information and risk assessment for tiotropium
based on newly available data. Some clarification in regard to inclusion and
exclusion criteria was introduced. The amendment also clarified the process to
administer information to the patient and collect assent from t

 he patient in case
the patient him/herself was not able to read or sign him/herself.
01 April 2015 With the second amendment, the CTP was updated with definitions and
procedures used by
the sponsor for AEs, SAEs, AESI, and reporting of such events. To be in line with
other
clinical trials of the same development program, the endpoint ‘FEF25-75 response
determined
at the end of the 48-week treatment period’ was amended to ‘individual FEF25-75
response at
each time point and visit during the 48-week treatment period’. The following
further
endpoints were added for the same reason: FEV1 peak0-3h expressed as
percentage of patient’s
predicted FEV1 after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, trough FEV1 expressed as
percentage of
patient’s predicted FEV1 after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, time to first
symptomatic
asthma exacerbation during the 48-week treatment period, ACQ-IA6 and ACQ-IA6
responder. The description of the safety analyses was amended to remove
frequency tables
with the number and percentage of patients with marked changes in vital signs
recorded in
conjunction with spirometry at any time during the trial and at each time point
separately by
treatment. Furthermore, the amendment introduced changes to include updated
information
on tiotropium based on newly available data and to correct minor typographical
errors and
inconsistencies.
