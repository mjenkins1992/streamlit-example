General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
The objectives were to characterise the dose-response relationship, identify the target dose for Phase III
development, and investigate the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of BI 655064 administered
subcutaneously for 52 weeks as add-on therapy to standard of care treatment in patients with active
lupus nephritis.
Protection of trial subjects:
Only subjects that met all the study inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were to be entered in
the study. All subjects were free to withdraw from the clinical trial at any time for any reason given.
Close monitoring of all subjects was adhered to throughout the trial conduct. Rescue medication was
allowed for all patients as required.

Recruitment
Recruitment details:
This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of BI 655064
administered as subcutaneous injections, on renal response after one year of treatment, in patients with
active lupus nephritis.
Pre-assignment
Screening details:
All patients were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Patients attended a specialist
site which ensured that they (the patients) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.
Patients were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.

Primary: Percentage of patients with complete renal response (CRR) at week 52
End point title Percentage of patients with complete renal response (CRR) at
week 52
End point description:
Complete renal response (CRR) was defined as urine protein (UP) < 0.5 g/day at Week 52 and either
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within normal range at Week 52 or decrease in eGFR < 20%
from baseline at Week 52 if eGFR was below normal range (below lower limit of normal [LLN], where
LLN = 90 mL/min).
CRR at Week 52 (derived using UP from the 24 h urine collections) was analyzed using a logistic
regression model. Factors in the model included treatment and the covariates race (Asian/Non-Asian)
Clinical trial results 2015-001750-15 version 2 EU-CTR publication date: 14 November 2021 Page 10  of 44
and proteinuria at screening (UP/urine creatinine (UC) <3 or >=3 g/day).
Pairwise comparisons of the modelled proportions of patients with CRR at each dose level to placebo
were performed.
Intent to treat (ITT) set: This patient set included all patients from the treated set who had a baseline
(or screening) proteinuria (spot urine could be used if a patient did not have 24 h urine collections) and
a baseline or screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value.

Partial renal response (PRR) was defined as at least 50% reduction of proteinuria from baseline if
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was within normal range at time of assessment or decrease
of eGFR <20% from baseline if eGFR was below normal range at time of assessment.
Intent to treat (ITT) set: This patient set included all patients from the treated set who had a baseline
(or screening) proteinuria (spot urine could be used if a patient did not have 24 h urine collections) and
a baseline or screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value.

More information
Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
24 November 2015 Inclusion criterion 3 was revised to allow the inclusion of patients with a positive
antidsDNA antibody at screening or around the time of start of induction therapy.
Initially the patients had to have a positive anti-dsDNA antibody at screening.
Exclusion criterion 9 (‘live vaccination within 6 weeks before randomisation’) was
added.
02 February 2016 According to the updated SmPC for MMF, additional requirements for pregnancy
tests and contraception methods, as well as recommendations regarding blood
and semen donation were added in the respective sections of the CTP.
24 November 2016 Statements were included that vital status information was to be collected at
Week 60 (EOS visit) for randomised patients who discontinued from the study
before EOS.
Inclusion criterion 1 was revised: Women of childbearing potential were to use '2
reliable methods of birth control, one of which should be highly effective’ instead
of '2 highly effective methods of birth control’. Also, in the definition of ‘women of
nonchildbearing potential’, ‘tubal occlusion’ was removed as a sterilisation
method.
In exclusion criterion 4, the definition of antiphospholipid syndrome was modified.
This had been requested by authorities.
The following AEs were defined as AESIs (in addition to ‘hepatic injury’): injection
reactions including anaphylactic reaction, cytokine release syndrome,
opportunistic infections and/or severe infections, lymphoproliferative disorders
(e.g. B- and T-cell lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma,
hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma), thrombosis and adjunct immunosuppression.
Other additional changes have been applied.
17 February 2017 If a higher dose of i.v. steroids was considered necessary by the investigator, a
total dose of up to 3 g was acceptable for initial induction treatment.
06 October 2017 Proteinuria at screening <3 g/day or ≥3 g/day was also defined as UP/UC <3 or
UP/UC ≥3.
Inclusion criterion 3 was modified: one of the documented criteria for SLE had to
be a positive anti-dsDNA antibody or a positive antinuclear antibody.
The following exclusion criterion was deleted: ‘acute presence of oliguria (<500
mL/day)’.
Further instructions with regard to steroids tapering were added.
07 September 2018 For the AESI ‘opportunistic infections and/or severe infections’, the following text
was added as requested by the DMC: ‘Whenever a patient comes to a visit and
reports of an (S)AE related to infections, which occurred in the interval since the
last visit, then he/she is routinely asked whether they have been seen/treated by
a physician and whether blood
samples had been taken in that context. Should this be answered in the
affirmative, then efforts should be undertaken to collect the respective
information’.
A statement was added that if a partner of a male trial participant became
pregnant this had to be reported and written consent of the pregnant partner was
required.
