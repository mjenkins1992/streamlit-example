General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) at doses of 100
and 200mg/day compared with placebo (PBO) as adjunctive treatment in adult focal epilepsy subjects
with partial-onset seizures (POS) not fully controlled despite current treatment with 1 or 2 concomitant
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
Protection of trial subjects:
Subject’s informed consent must be obtained and documented in accordance with local regulations, ICH-
GCP requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Prior to obtaining informed consent, information should be given in a language and at a level of
complexity understandable to the subject in both oral and written form by the Investigator (or
designee). Each subject will have the opportunity to discuss the study and its alternatives with the
Investigator.

Statistical analysis description:
Hazard ratios and treatment group comparisons are based on a semi-parametric hazards regression
model with number of days to nth seizure as the outcome and an effect for treatment, an effect for
pooled country, and an effect for the four combinations of stratification levels for number of previous
AEDs and LEV Status, and log-transformed Baseline POS frequency as a continuous covariate.

Adverse events
Adverse events information
Timeframe for reporting adverse events:
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) were collected during the study, which began in Dec 2010
and concluded in May 2014.
Adverse event reporting additional description:
TEAEs are comprised of the Safety Population, which consists of all randomized subjects who receive at
least 1 dose of study medication.
The Non-serious Adverse Events section represents a >= 5% threshold of subjects experiencing Non-
serious TEAEs in any treatment group and not the total population.

More information
Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
15 September 2011 The protocol was amended for the following reasons:
•Procedures for reporting SAEs were updated to implement the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) Final Rule requirements (Investigational new drug safety
reporting requirements for human drug and biological products and safety
reporting requirements for bioavailability and bioequivalence studies in humans,
21 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 312 and 320, 2010).
•The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was added to address the
requirement of the FDA that prospective assessments for suicidality be included in
clinical studies involving all drugs for neurological indications.
There were also a few minor changes made to the protocol to update the name of
the company, name and address of Study Physician, and SAE reporting contact
numbers, and to clarify some study conduct details.
Notes:
Interruptions (globally)
Were there any global interruptions to the trial?  No
Limitations and caveats
None reported
