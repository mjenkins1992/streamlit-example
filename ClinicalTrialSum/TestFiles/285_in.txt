End point description:
The ASQoL was an 18-item questionnaire assessed the amount of restriction subject experienced in daily
activities, level of pain and fatigue, and the impact on the subject's emotional state. Each item was
scored as 0 (no impact) or 1 (yes - impact). A total score was calculated by summing the items. The
total score ranged from 0 (no impact) to 18 (yes-impact), with higher values indicated more impaired
health-related quality of life. FAS: included all subjects who were randomised to the study and received
at least one dose of the randomised investigational product (i.e., tofacitinib or placebo). Here, on-drug
data was used and missing response was not imputed. Here "number of subjects analysed" signifies

End point description:
BASFI was a functional index which included 10 items assessing ability of subjects to perform normal
daily activities. The first 8 questions/items consider activities related to functional anatomy. The final 2
questions/items assess the subjects’ ability to cope with everyday life. Each item was scored on a scale
of 0=easy to 10=impossible. The BASFI total score was calculated as the average score of these 10
individual items. BASFI total score ranged from 0 (easy) to 10 (impossible), where higher scores
indicated more severe disease activity. FAS: included all subjects who were randomised to the study and
received at least one dose of the randomised investigational product (i.e., tofacitinib or placebo). Here,
on-drug data was used and missing response was not imputed. Here "number of subjects analysed"

End point description:
BASDAI was validated questionnaire that consisted of 6 questions pertaining to 5 major symptoms of
AS: fatigue; spinal pain; peripheral arthritis; enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness, duration of
morning stiffness. Each question was rated using numerical rating scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very
severe), high score=high disease activity. BASDAI score was calculated by computing mean of Q 5 and
6, adding it to sum of questions 1 to 4. This score was then divided by 5. The total BASDAI score was
ranged from 0= none to 10= very severe, where high score indicated high disease activity. FAS:
included all subjects who were randomised to the study and received at least one dose of the
randomised investigational product. Here, on-drug data was used and missing response was not
imputed. Here "number of subjects analysed" = subjects analysed for this end point.

End point description:
BASDAI: validated questionnaire that consist of 6 question pertaining to 5 major symptom of AS:
fatigue; spinal pain; peripheral arthritis; enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness, duration of morning
stiffness. Each question was rate using numerical rating scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe), high
score=high disease activity. BASDAI score calculate by computing mean of Q5 and Q6 and adding it to
sum of questions 1 to 4. This score was then divided by 5. Total BASDAI score range from 0= none to
10= very severe, high score=high disease activity. BASDAI50 response defined as decrease of >=50%
from Baseline in BASDAI score at specified time point. Percentage of subjects with BASDAI 50 response
at specified weeks are reported. FAS: included all subjects who were randomized, received at least one
dose of randomised investigational product. Here, on-drug data was used, MR=NR.

Chest expansion (measured in centimetres (cm), is defined as difference in thoracic circumference
during full expiration versus full inspiration. This was measured at 4th intercostal space. Difference
between maximal inspiration and expiration of two attempts was recorded. Better of two attempts was
used to calculate chest expansion which was defined to be greater than or equal to 0 cm with no defined
maximum/upper limit. Greater chest circumference corresponds to higher score indicated more spinal
mobility/better health status (measured as Chest Expansion in cm). FAS: included all subjects who were
randomised to the study and received at least one dose of the randomised investigational product (i.e.,
tofacitinib or placebo). Here, on-drug data was used and missing response was not imputed. Here
"number of subjects analysed" signifies subjects analysed for this end point.

End point description:
EQ-5D-3L, a health profile questionnaire was used to assess quality of life along 5 dimensions. Subjects
rated 5 aspects of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression)
by choosing from 3 answering options (1=no problems; 2=some problems; 3=extreme problems). The
mean of the summed score ranged from 1 to 3 with "1" corresponding to no problems and "3"
corresponding to severe problems in the 5 dimensions, where higher score indicates more severe
problems. FAS: included all subjects who were randomised to the study and received at least one dose
of the randomised investigational product (i.e., tofacitinib or placebo). Here, on-drug data was used and
missing response was not imputed. Here "number of subjects analysed" signifies subjects analysed for
