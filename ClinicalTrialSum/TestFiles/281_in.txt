General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
1) To determine the safety and efficacy of fesoterodine 4 milligram (mg) and 8 mg following once daily
treatment for 12 weeks in pediatric neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) subjects with weight greater
than (>) 25 kilogram (kg). 2) To determine the safety and efficacy of fesoterodine 2 mg and 4 mg
following once daily treatment for 12 weeks in pediatric NDO subjects with weight less than or equal to
(<=) 25 kg.
Protection of trial subjects:
The study was in compliance with the ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in
compliance with all International Council for Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
guidelines. All the local regulatory requirements pertinent to safety of trial subjects were followed.

End point title Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Urgency Episodes
per 24 Hours at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase
(ACP)/Efficacy Phase (EP)
End point description:
The mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours were calculated as the total number of urgency
episodes divided by the total number of diary days collected at the assessment time point. Number of
diary days collected at the assessment time point = number of calendar days when the diary was
completed; even if it was not a full 24 hour period. Urgency episodes were defined as urgency marked
as ‘yes’ in the diary. This endpoint was only calculated for subjects with >0 urgency episodes at Baseline
and who were sensate. Full analysis set included all subjects who were randomised in the study and
received at least 1 dose of study medication and had provided baseline primary endpoint data. Here
‘Number of Subjects Analysed’ signifies subjects evaluable for this endpoint.

Phase/Efficacy Phase
End point description:
The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine
motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with
randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they
can be inserted. Subjects were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit
(up to 300 seconds). The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant
hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to
the cognitive ability. Safety analysis set analyzed. 10-peg assessment was done only in subjects below
age of 9 years. "N”: subjects evaluable for this endpoint and “n”: subjects evaluable for this endpoint for
specified rows. 1 subject inadvertently did the 10-peg test with non-dominant hand and 25-peg test with
dominant hand. This subject was counted in 10 peg and 25 peg assessment.

End point description:
The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine
motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with
randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they
can be inserted. Subjects were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit
(up to 300 seconds). The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant
hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Number of pegs dropped while putting in the holes were
measured. Subjects were assigned to either a 10- or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 10-peg
assessment was done on subjects below age of 9 years. Safety analysis set population for safety
extension phase analysed. Here “N”: subjects evaluable for this endpoint and “n”: subjects evaluable for
this endpoint for specified rows.
