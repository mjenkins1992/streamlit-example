 Brivaracetamusreatment of focal seizures in peoplewith epilepsy.
What was this study about?
The purpose of this study was to find out how well 
brivaracetams worked in participantswith focal seizures not 
controlled by other epilepsy drugs.  The participantswere 16 to 80 years old.
They had focal seizures that were not   controlled by 
another seizure 
medicine.
The participantswere divided into 4 groups:

out whether brivar Clinical Study Results   For the Treatment of Inflammation and Respiratory Refractory Reflux (CREF) Study Number: N01358    2014-0013-0014   What was the Study Called?  The N1358 study was done to find out:  Brivaracetam is an  
 experimental medicine that may reduce inflammation and improve 
inflammation in patients with refractory reflux (refractory to treatment).  BRV is a   investigational medicine that is 
being tested for the treatment of inflammation and refractor- oedema (inflammation of 
the lungs and sinuses).   the condition is called refractor’s

 Brivaractam is used to treat inflammatory diseases of the lungs and 
to treat refractories.   The main goal of this study was to find 
out if Brivar acetam improves inflammation in patients 
who have refractors to treatment.

 b e 7 7 1 Brivaracetam is a prescription medicine used to treat seizures. It is used to reduce seizures in people with epilepsy. It works by stopping the brain from making electrical impulses that cause the brain to involuntarily control the body. This stops the body from making too many electrical signals that can cause seizures. A seizure is a sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain. This can cause symptoms such as shaking, loss of consciousness, or loss of control of body movements. There are many types of seizures, but the most common type is a partial onset seizure. This type of seizure occurs when the brain is not able to control the electrical activity of the brain properly.  Brivaracetams are among the most commonly used seizure medications. They reduce the frequency of these seizures by reducing the electrical current through the brain and slowing down or stopping it down.  They also reduce the number of times the brain makes these signals.    1   2   3   4  5   5 1  5 2  5 What was the main goal of this study?

 A  Brivaracetam is a prescription medicine for the treatment of seizures. It is used to treat seizures in people with certain types of epilepsy. It works by reducing the electrical activity in the brain that causes the brain to involuntarily produce electrical activity. This can cause symptoms such as shaking, loss of consciousness, or loss of control of body movements.   Brivar acetamethasone (Briacetam) is an acetaminophen (Ame) that is approved for use in the 
use of epilepsy treatment. It has been shown to reduce the frequency of seizures in 
patients with type 1 and type 2 epilepsy. 
But, it is not widely used in type 3 epilepsy. Brivaractam is 
taken by mouth and is not approved for the use of children and young people with type 2 
or 3 type 4 epilepsy. Therefore, there was a need to 
study whether it would reduce the number of seizures and how well it works.  brivaracetmics are 
used to treat type 2 and 3 type 1 
type 2 and 4 type 2 seizures.  1  
There is no cure for type 1 type 2 or 3 type 3 
antiepileptic seizures. There is a treatment for type 4 type 1 epilepsy using 
a medicine called methylprednisolone (Mdn). 
Mdn is a commonly used 
medicine that is  1 mg of acetaminone 
sold in the united states. It reduces the number and intensity of 
2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 
9,9, and lowers the risk of having a type 1 or 2 type 3 or 4 
diarrhythmic seizure.  : n O

 How was this study done? Brivaracetam is a prescription medicine used to treat seizures in young people with epilepsy. It works by stopping the brain from making electrical impulses that cause the brain to involuntarily produce electrical activity. This can cause a seizure.   Use of the data and information contained in this summary is unrestricted, provided that it may not be used in applications by others for regulatory approval of a product. While not required, when using these data, we ask that proper credit or attribution of the source of the information be given. We thank all study participants who took part in this clinical study. You helped us to answer important questions about the use of Brivaracetamusicetm and the benefits of taking it compared to placebo.  What were the main results of this study?   • A total of 508 participants took part.  • The study included 259 participants in the study who took 200 mg Brivaracetm group and 249 participants who used the placebo. • The average age of the participants was 22.5 years. • During the study, the participants were divided into 4 groups. • One group took Brivaractam 200 mg per day, and the other 4 groups took the placebo (no medicine). • The other 3 groups took different doses of the same medicine. • Each group was divided into 2 groups by how often the participants had a seizure during the study. • At the start of the study and during the 12 week treatment period, participants were asked to record their seizure frequency.  The participants also reported any medical problems that they had during this time.  During the 12 weeks of the treatment period. 
 • The main goal of the researchers wanted to achieve in this study was to find out how many participants had seizures during the first 12 week of the 12-week treatment period and how many had during the second week. • To find out if the participants in each group had more seizures during this 12 week period than in the placebo group.  Overall, the researchers found that there were more participants who had more than one seizure during this study than in any other study period. The most common type of seizure was a type I seizure. The researchers found this to be more common in participants who were taking the placebo than in those who were using Brivaraccetm.  There were also more participants taking the other two groups who reported having more than two seizures during their first 12 weeks in the treatment periods.  This study showed that the participants taking either group had less than average number of seizures Clinical Study Results Study Sponsor: Brivaracetamirata Drug Studied: A study to find out how safe and effective a medicine containing
