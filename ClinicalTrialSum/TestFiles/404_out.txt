 visited the study center twice during the first and second week of the 28 week study. The first visit was on day 1 and the second was on week 28. The researchers collected information on the participants’ 
 health using a questionnaire.  What happened during this study?
 The researchers also asked the participants to record what they thought about their health during the study. They asked the following questions: A study to find out how well daprodustat works in participants with anaemia.    The study was done to see how well a medicine called daprazole works to treat anaemia in participants who have never been treated with it. anaemia is a disease of the bone marrow. It is characterized by anemia and low red blood cells. 
.  anaemia can cause many different symptoms, such as tiredness,weight loss,bone pain,bone marrow failure,bone loss, and loss of bone marrow function.  There is no cure for anaemia, but it can be treated with medicines that suppress the activity of thebone marrow. These medicines may lead to bone marrow dysfunction.  daprdustat is a type of medicine that is being used to treat bone marrow anaemia and is approved for use in adults.  it works by stopping the growth of a protein called bacilli.  in bone marrow cells. This protein is responsible for the production of anemia-related hormones.  bacillin and its receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, taiyangin, which are involved in the regulation of bacillus calmettein.  r p p p A \ d e The purpose of this study was to see if a medicine that blocks the growth and function of bone- marrow cells  called dicarbametaxel (also known as bacilizumab or tacopramide) works better than bacillin in improving the symptoms caused by anaemia compared to placebo.  1   d e v o r p A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.  2 0. bacilitine is used to help people with bone marrow cancer.  3 0.9 0.1 baciliologists use this medicine to treat their patients with bone-mall bone-marrow cancer. 4 0  : n O  d This study compared the effects of dapridustat with placebo in participants whose bone marrow had not yet been treated.  4 0.0.  0.2.  e The study took place of patients at a study center in the united kingdom.  9 1 e This study was also done in a university hospital in korea.  5048 participants were included in the study.  n:  5047 participants 3947 were women and 3948 were men.  4947 were from the same ethnic background.

Overview   Why was this study done? Researchers are looking for a better way to measure and compare the effects of daprdestat with placebo in participants who are taking it. D.A. Dapridustat is a prescription medicine that is used to treat people with type2 diabetes. It works by helping the body to control inflammation and pain caused by certain types of bacteria.  What were the results of this study?   The main aim of this summary is to share the results from this study.  1. General information An individual’s health is measured using a tool called the EuroQol (quality of life) survey. It measures the participants’ overall health using a visual analogue scale.  2. When people are in the study for more than 28 weeks, they are asked to complete a questionnaire about their overall health. 3. What medical problems did the participants have during this time?  How did they do?  The participants were divided into 2 groups of about the same size. The first group was assessed by the study doctor. This was called the study doctors. The second group was the participants who came to the study center for the first time.  d. A computer program was used to randomly choose the groups.  The study included 222 participants.  They were between the ages of 18 and 75.  Why were the participants included in this research study? The main goal of the study was to see if the participants had any medical problems during the study. Researchers already did a physical examination before the study, blood pressure was checked at the first visit, and the participants were checked again at the second visit.

study.  Study Number: 1071-1072-01 
 Why was this study done? 
 The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were: 
 Did smoking affect the participants heart?   What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
 The answers to these questions are discussed in more detail in this section.  What were the most common heart problems the participants had during this study?  There were 
Some participants who had both heart problems and those who had only heart problems.  More details about the results 
are provided in the summaries when these results are available.
    Overview   How was the research done?
The researchers studied the effects of smoking in a large number of participants.  The participants were divided into 
five groups by race.  Group 1 (overall):  Men Women  Study design 
The participants were followed for up to 12 months.  Men were included in the study if they had:  Overall, the participants were in good health.  Atrial fibrillation (afibrillation) was the most frequently reported heart problem.   Shortness of breath (shortness of stay in the hospital) was also reported frequently.  Unwanted medical events (exacerbation of any kind) were also reported in 
almost half of the participants.
Other heart problems were rare but they were common.  There was a strong association between the number of heart problems reported in the   study and the participant’s 
health.  cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction and stroke), 
respiratory tract infection (including pneumonia), and 
angina pectoris (the commonest cause of chest pain). 
Other conditions that affect the heart were also discussed.
There were also differences between the groups.
