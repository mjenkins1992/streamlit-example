Notes:
General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
The main objective of the trial was to evaluate efficacy and safety of ASP0113 compared to placebo in
reducing the incidence of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia through 1 year post first study drug injection
in CMV-seronegative participants who received a kidney from a CMV-seropositive donor.
Protection of trial subjects:
This clinical study was written, conducted and reported in accordance with the protocol, International
Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good
Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and applicable local regulations, including the European Directive
2001/20/EC, on the protection of human rights, and with the ethical principles that have their origin in
the Declaration of Helsinki. Astellas ensures that the use and disclosure of protected health information
(PHI) obtained during a research study complies with the federal, national and/or regional legislation
related to the privacy and protection of personal information.
Background therapy:
In the first 10 days after the transplant, patients received prophylactic valganciclovir or ganciclovir (dose
per package insert) from the day of randomization to prevent Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. After
randomization, patients continued to receive valganciclovir or ganciclovir until 100 days post-transplant.
Valganciclovir or ganciclovir could be interrupted, dose adjusted or replaced by other CMV-specific
antiviral prophylaxis (AVP) per standard of care after the day of randomization.

Subject disposition
Recruitment
Recruitment details:
A total of 150 participants were enrolled into the study from 6 countries. Eligible participants were ≥18
years of age, CMV-seronegative at the time of the transplant and had a kidney allograft from a CMV-
seropositive living or deceased donor. After the primary period completion, 149 participants entered the
long-term follow-up period.
Pre-assignment
Screening details:
Screening assessments were performed from 14-30 days after the transplant. Patients were randomized
at day 30, in relation to the day of the transplant, in a 1:1 ratio to ASP0113 or placebo. Participants
were stratified by the use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) prior to randomization and by the receipt of a
kidney from a living or deceased donor.

Period 1 title Primary Study Period (overall period)
Is this the baseline period? Yes

Blinding implementation details:
This was a double-blind study. Participants were randomized to receive ASP0113 or placebo in a double-
blind fashion such that the investigator, sponsor’s study management team, clinical staff nor the
participant knew which agent was being administered.

CMV viremia was defined as presence of cytomegalovirus as measured in plasma viral load of ≥ 1000
IU/mL by central laboratory assay. A participants who discontinued the study without a positive CMV
viral load was imputed as having a CMV viremia. A participant who had more than one viral load ≥ 1000
IU/mL by central assay was counted once in this summary. CMV viral loads after first injection (Day 1)
through Day 380 (scheduled or unscheduled) were included in the analysis. The analysis population was
the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which consisted of all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of
randomized study drug and who had at least 1 post dose viral load assessment within 1 year post first
injection by central laboratory.

More information
Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
13 August 2013 Key changes in Substantial Amendment 1, dated 13 Aug 2013, are summarized
below. • Patients with graft failure would be discontinued from treatment • 1-
sided P value (not 2-sided) would be used for testing the hypothesis • Urinalysis
with microscopic evaluation was added to the safety labs • Vital signs for
reactogenicity assessments were added • Screening laboratory tests could be
repeated once • Collect creatinine values during the long-term follow-up period, if
available
06 January 2014 Key changes in Substantial Amendment 2, dated 06 Jan 2014, are summarized
below. ● Screening period could begin -14 days from transplant to day of
randomization ● Redefined CMV viremia as plasma viral load ≥ 1000 IU/mL ●
Expanded stratification criteria for ATG to day of randomization ● Revised CMV
AVP period of adjustment to after the day of randomization ● Added vital signs
and evaluation of patients 15 minutes after study drug injection ● Inclusion
Criterion 5 - clarified patients received valganciclovir or ganciclovir per regulatory
label (package insert) ● Exclusion Criteria: Excluded patients who required dialysis
on day of randomization, Deleted criterion that excluded patients who had an
episode of hyperacute or acuterejection prior to Randomization, Excluded patients
who received eculizumab, bortezomib, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
and/or plasmapheresis from day of transplantation through day of randomization,
Clarified contraindications to prophylaxis of CMV viremia/disease with
valganciclovir and ganciclovir, Clarified a contraindication to an intramuscular
injection also included those who were expected to have a contraindication to the
injection, Clarified aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) criteria was within 3 days prior to randomization, Concomitant medications
– included several clarifications (dose adjustments, interruptions to therapy, time
periods for prohibited medications, recording) and additional prohibited
medications, Spontaneously reported SAEs during long-term follow-up that were
possibly or probably related to study drug should be reported. ● Patients with a
temperature ≥ 100.4°F should not receive study drug ● Transplant surgery on day
0 would not be considered an AE or SAE
