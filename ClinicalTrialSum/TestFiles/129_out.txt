Participants were expected to participate in this study for 
up to 104 weeks. The study started in February 2016 and ended in July 
2018.
Who took part in the study?
563 adult patients from Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, 
Japan, the 
United States, and the Republic of Korea participated in the 1311.4  study.
The study included men and women with plaque

searchers also found that patients who stopped treatment for a while had a 
small increase in Risankizumabbreviated as BI 655066 is a new type of tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNF)-positive antibody that is being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.    Risanki- zumab is used to treat type 1 diabetes. It works by interfering with the activity of the tNF receptor, which leads to an increase in the number of genes involved in the body’s response to a given tumour.  rrisankiab is approved for use in people with type 2   diabetes and type 1 obesity.  risankiaba is not approved for   use in   people with other types of diabetes. The main goal of this study was to find out

The patches can be very painful to the skin and cause redness, redness and scaling of the skin.  There are many types of psoriatic arthritis (arthritis), but psoratic arthritis is the most common type. There are two types of arthritis: type A (joint pain and stiffness) and type B (arthritic spina b fracture). Both are caused by damage to the joints and tendons in the spine. There is no known cure for type B arthritis.  Risankizumab is a medicine that works by targeting a protein in the immune system. It blocks the activity of certain proteins that cause inflammation in the joints. It is called an antibody.  It is used to treat people with type Aarthritis.  The main purpose of this study was to find out if risankiab works to treat type Barthoricapart from improving joint pain, it may also reduce the signs and symptoms of type Bthritis.    psorasis is a common skin disease. It affects millions of people worldwide. It causes the body to produce white scales that resemble white scales. The scales can be different from each other and vary from very mild to very severe. The severity of the psorasmic surface areas can vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goal of the study 
 is to find the best time for people to take part in a clinical trial to find a treatment for type barthritic spine pain and psoriasis.  risankaib. 
This summary focuses on the results from a 16-week study of 507 participants with type Boriatica psorasthma who took part A1 or part B of risakiab. Part A1.  part A 1 is called the “baseline study” and includes 507participants who were in the study and 494participants in the part B study.  Part A2 is called “Part B.”

What were the main results of the clinical study? 
The results of this summary will be shown in the clinical results summary.  Why was this study done?Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes the skin to become scaly, red, itchy, and covered with white scales. It is caused by the body’s immune system, which mistakenly attacks the skin instead.   psoriasis affects millions of people worldwide. It can cause many different types of skin diseases, including psoriatic arthritis, eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, and rheumatism. There are currently no approved treatments for psoriassery.  risankizumab is a type of treatment for psoriaisinosis. It works by targeting a protein in the immune system that is responsible for the immune response to the body.  it blocks the activity of the immunesystem, which leads to psoriasis.  The main goal of this study was to learn more about how risankainkizmab works and about its safety in people with psoriasis. The study also looked at the benefits of risakiin the treatment of psoriasmis.  psoriases.  What was the main result of the study?   The results of the clinical study are described in this summary.

 psoriasaisses.  Risankiasesis is an immune system response disorder. It causes the body to reject foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and other germs.  It can lead to skin rashes, redness, swelling, and swelling of the joints.  There are treatments that can stop or reduce the signs and symptoms of psorsiasis, but these treatments may not work for some people. There was a need to find a better treatments for people who have psoriastinosis.  In this study, researchers wanted to find out if risakinthe study drug works to treat patients with severe psoriaseis. riskanada-siinibib (also known as 2-tiinib and vedoxinib).   What were the main results of this research?  Overall, the study showed that the patients’ ps  psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes the skin to become covered with white scales and red patches. The patches are located on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. They are called patches of psoriaticaerythematosus (PASI) and are caused by the body’s immune system.  risankizumab is a medicine that is being developed to treat psoriases.  psorasis is a common skin disease that causes patches of skin to develop on the body.   psoriasis is characterized by the skin developing red, itchy, scaly, and itchy red patches with white scaling.  There are many types of psoriaensis, but psorosis is the most common type. There are treatments for psoriasitis, but there are few studies that have compared them.  - ITT_A1, -ITT_ A1-ID, -ITT_A2,-ITT_2, -CTR,-CTR-1,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13,-14,-15,-16,-17,-18,-19,-20,-21,-22,-23,-24,-25,-26,-27,-29,-30,-31,-32,-33,-34,-35,-36,-37,-38,-39,-40,-41,-43,-42,-44,-45,-46,-47,-49,-50,-51,-53,-54,-55,-56,-58,-59,-60,-63,-65,-67,-70,-73,-84,-85,-86,-87,-89,-90,-100,-98,-99,-1010,-97,-94,-95,-105,-106,-115,-120,-126,-133,-128,-129,-132,-134,-135,-143,-150,-165,-174,-195,-196,-193,-194,-214,-215,-223,-255,-286,-293,-295 Why was this study done? What is psoriasis?Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes the skin to become covered with white scales called patches. The patches can be very painful and itchy, itchiness, and redness. There are many types of psoriatic rashes, but the most common are on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. The skin rashes are caused by a small molecule called risankizumab, which is approved for use in people with psori-Sars.  r is used to treat patients with other types of rashes.  psoriasis is a common skin disease that affects millions of people around the world. It is caused by the rashes of psorasis, which are covered by white scales.  There are treatments for psoriases, but they may not work well for all patients. There is a need to find new treatments that can improve the symptoms and quality of life in patients with psoratic rheumatoid arthritis.    ri-sars is a type of arthritis that can cause rashes and swelling of the joints and skin.  The study drug, risanka-siab (also known as 2-kinase inhibitor), is approved to treat people with rashes but is not approved to use in clinical trials.  It works by targeting a small protein called ras that is found in rashes caused by ras. ras in the ras to stop it from multiplying and causing inflammation in the joints.  - ITT_A1   1  : n O

 psoriasmic arthritis (PASI) score is a composite score that measures the severity of psorasis. PASI scores vary from 0 to 72 depending on severity. The severity of each sign 
was assessed using a 5-point scale. The study drug, risankizumaab, was given as a single injection under the skin at 4 and 28 weeks in a small injection site under the arm.  (called a subcutaneous injection).  
Participants were divided into 2 groups by chance (randomization). The first group received risankaib at a dose of 150 milligrams per week for 4 weeks. The second group received a placebo. The placebo looked just like the study drug but did not contain any medicine. The third group received the placebo at a similar to the first group. The participants in the third and fourth groups received the same dose of risankaibaib at the same time. The main aim of the study was 
to see if the participants would have a reduction in their PASi score compared with the baseline score.  the reduction in the PASIt score was defined as a 100% reduction in severity from the 
baseline score. The researchers wanted to know:
  How many participants in this study had a reduction of 100% in their psoriastro-association
