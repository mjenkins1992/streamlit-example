assessments according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST1.1). Objective
disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions,

End point description:
Number of participants with confirmed objective disease progression (PD) at the time of the participant's
last evaluable response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST1.1) assessment. PD was defined
as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest
sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. PD-L1 negative
was defined as <25% of tumor cells with membrane staining for PD-L1 at any intensity.

End point description:
The percentage of PD-L1 negative participants who experienced an objective response (complete
response [CR] or partial response [PR]), based on investigator assessments according to response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST1.1). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target
lesions (TLs) since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in
short axis to <10 mm. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TLs,
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. PD-L1 negative was defined as <25% of tumor cells
with membrane staining for PD-L1 at any intensity.

End point title Time to Deterioration in European Organisation for Research
and Treatment of Cancer 30-item core quality of life
questionnaire, version 3 (EORTC QLQ-C30)
End point description:
The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions that can be combined to produce functional scales (e.g.
physical), symptom scales (e.g. fatigue), and a global measure of health status. Each of the scales are
measured from 0 to 100. Deterioration was defined as a 10-point decrease from baseline in a
functioning or global health status/ quality of life score or a 10-point increase from baseline in a
symptom score.

Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
14 January 2015 Updates to the following: - Management of non-immune-related toxicity using
dose modifications. - Stratification factors changed to include PD-L1 status. -
‘Deep sustained response’ (DSR) endpoint removed. - Change to pre-specify
stratified log-rank test as primary method of analysis for OS and PFS in all-comers
population, while retaining the weighted HR approach as a supportive analysis. -
PD-L1 status added as a pre-specified subgroup analysis.
03 April 2015 Updates to the following: - Change to doses of durvalumab and tremelimumab in
the combination arm. - Clarification of procedures regarding discontinuation or
retreatment in cases of confirmed PD. - Modifications to eligibility criteria. -
Changes to endpoints and assessments.
01 June 2015 Updates to the following: - Eligibility criteria modified. - Clarification that no
further enrolment into the durvalumab monotherapy arm applies to patients with
PD-L1-negative tumors, should external data suggest lack of benefit of
durvalumab monotherapy in the PD-L1 negative population.
18 February 2016 Updates to the following: - Co-primary endpoint of PFS removed, leaving only a
primary endpoint of OS (accordingly, the multiple testing procedure was
simplified). - Primary objective clarified as assessment of durvalumab +
tremelimumab vs SoC in PD-L1-positive and -negative patients (ie, regardless of
PD-L1 status). (throughout the document). - Previous primary comparison
included monotherapy vs SoC in PD-L1-positive patients. - Clarification of key
secondary objectives. - PFS, ORR, DoR, DCR, APF6, APF12 to be based on
Investigator assessment rather than BICR. - PRO measures reduced and
prioritised for formal analysis. - PRO for CTCAE reduced from collection of 30 PRO-
CTCAE symptoms to 11. - Eligibility criteria modified. - Removal of text referring
to possibility of halting enrolment of PD-L1- negative patients into the durvalumab
monotherapy arm. - Definition of disease progression now to include clinical
disease progression as well as confirmed objective disease progression. - Removal
of the requirement to confirm response (amended to objective response). -
Addition of one interim analysis for OS at 80% maturity, when 314 death events
have occurred across the combination and SoC arms. - Update sample size
estimate calculation and statistical assumptions. - Added analysis of patients with
subsequent anticancer therapy. - HPV testing and analysis of OS by HPV status in
patients with oropharyngeal cancer only. - Addition of subgroup analysis by race. -
Management of study drug-related toxicities modified. - The timing and
procedures for scheduled assessments and/or study design were modified and
clarified.

07 September 2016 Updates to the following: - Change from single primary objective of durvalumab +
tremelimumab vs SoC in terms of OS to co-primary objectives of durvalumab +
tremelimumab vs SoC in terms of OS and durvalumab monotherapy vs SoC in
terms of OS. - Treatment in all arms to continue until progression. - Retreatment
sections updated to only allow retreatment for patients on the combination arm,
provided that progression occurs during the monotherapy portion of dosing. - The
hypothesis testing is expected to be performed after ~11 months of follow-up
instead of 10 months, and after ~375 death events have occurred instead of 392.
The number of events that triggers the interim analysis was reduced from 314 to
300. - The requirement for a min of 300 patients with PD-L1-positive disease was
removed and enrolment was to be based on the natural prevalence of PD-L1-
positive and -negative patients. - Updated to clarify that the specified PD-L1
expression cut-off level will be used for the purpose of stratification, however the
cut-off level to be used for the subgroup analyses by PD-L1 status and for
determining the PD-L1- negative subgroup in the MTP may be different and will be
determined from emerging data outside of this trial. - Updated to include text to
allow the study to stop for superiority based on interim OS analysis. - DoR will be
analysed by descriptive statistical and Kaplan Meier plots. - Primary tumor status,
prior radiation therapy, use of chewing tobacco, oral snuff, and sublingual
nicotine, smoking history, ECOG PS, prior lines of systemic therapy for treatment
of HNSCC, and extent of disease added as subgroups for analysis. - Weighted
estimate of the overall HR removed. - The sensitivity analyses and information on
the ascertainment bias, subgroup analysis and its display on forest plot, and
adjustment of significance level of testing were removed.
23 January 2018 Updates to the following: - Updates to various sections to align with the most
current safety information per the update to the Investigator’s Brochure. - New
section added for survival status for withdrawn consent and lost to follow-up
patients. - Clarification to collection of variables for SAEs. - New section added to
describe treatment with durvalumab after the final data cut-off. - Updates to allow
sites more flexibility in timing of survival calls after data cut-off.
10 September 2018 Updates to the following (12-Dec-2018): - New section added to the CSP (Safety
data to be collected following the final data cut-off of the study) to describe how
safety data would be recorded for patients continuing to receive study drug after
final data cut-off and database closure. - Treatment regimens text amended to
clarify that patients currently receiving treatment with durvalumab may be
transitioned to a roll-over or safety extension study after the analysis is finalized.
Notes:
Interruptions (globally)
Were there any global interruptions to the trial?  No
Limitations and caveats
Limitations of the trial such as small numbers of subjects analysed or technical problems leading to
unreliable data.
Multiple testing was performed for OS analysis in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and OS analysis in
the PD-L1 negative population for durvalumab + tremelimumab versus SoC only.
