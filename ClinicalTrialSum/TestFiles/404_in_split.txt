End point title Mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline and over the

End point description:
Blood samples were collected at given time points from participants for hemoglobin measurements.
Evaluation period hemoglobin value was defined as the mean of all available post-randomization
hemoglobin values (on and off-treatment) during the evaluation period (Week 24 to Week 28 inclusive).
For the primary analysis, the missing post-Baseline hemoglobin values were imputed using pre-specified
multiple imputations. Change from Baseline was defined as the average of post-randomization values
during the evaluation period minus Baseline value. Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose
assessment on or before the randomization date. Analysis was performed using the Analysis of
Covariance (ANCOVA) model with terms for treatment, Baseline hemoglobin, and region. Intent-to-Treat
(ITT) Population comprised all randomized participants regardless of whether they took study drug.

participant’s level of performance in the 8 health domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical (role
limitations caused by physical problems), Social Functioning, Bodily Pain, Mental Health, Role-Emotional
(role limitations caused by emotional problems), Vitality, and General Perception of Health.Each domain
is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Vitality domain score ranges from 0-100; higher
score indicates a better health state & better functioning. Change from Baseline was calculated as Post-
Dose Visit Value at Week 28 minus Baseline. For primary analysis, the missing on-treatment Week 28
SF-36 Vitality domain scores were imputed using pre-specified multiple imputations. Baseline value was
latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before randomization date. Analysis was performed using

End point description:
The EQ-5D-5L is a self-assessment questionnaire, consisting of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility,
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is measured by a 5-
point Likert scale (1: no problems, 2: slight problems, 3: moderate problems, 4: severe problems, and
5: extreme problems). The responses for the five dimension together form a five-figure description of
health state. Each of these five-figure health states has attached valuation (utility score), expressed as
single index on a scale from 0-1, where 1 is full health and 0 is worst health. The higher the score the
better the health status. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline.
Baseline value was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before the randomization date.

End point description:
The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the
endpoints are labeled ‘the best health you can imagine’ and ‘the worst health you can imagine’ at the
time of completion. It is a self-assessment visual analogue scale, ranging from 0=worst imaginable to
100=best. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline. Baseline value
was the latest non-missing pre-dose assessment on or before the randomization date. Adjusted mean
and standard error is presented. Only those participants with data available at indicated time points are
presented.

Adverse events
Adverse events information
Timeframe for reporting adverse events:
All cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious AEs were collected up to follow-up
(Week 32).
Adverse event reporting additional description:
Safety Population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study
treatment.Treatment emergent non-serious adverse events & serious adverse events are reported.One
participant who was randomized to placebo accidently received daprodustat during study & was
evaluated in daprodustat treatment group for safety outcome.

Reporting groups
Reporting group title Placebo
Reporting group description:
Participants received matching placebo once daily orally for up to 28 weeks followed by 4 weeks of
follow-up.
Reporting group title Daprodustat
Reporting group description:
Participants received daprodustat film-coated tablets with titrated dose levels ranging from 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, 16 milligrams (mg) once daily orally for up to 28 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. Study
treatment was dose-titrated to achieve and maintain hemoglobin in the target range (11 to 12 grams
