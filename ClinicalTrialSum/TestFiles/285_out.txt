 WHY WAS THIS STUDYOURSING SPONDYARD STUDY DONE? Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a 
inflammation of the joints that surround the spinal cord, spinal cord 
to the spine. It can cause pain, swelling, and loss of sensation in the 
skin, joints, and limbs. 
the symptoms can be severe and last for years. It is 
common in children and young adults.  
There are many different types of AS, but the most common 
type is active, which means that the symptoms are repeated over time. There are 
previous studies that have shown that tofacitinib (tofacitin) may reduce the activity of 
this inflammatory disease.  (taken as a tablet, or oral medicine, in the spine) improves the symptoms in 
people with AS. Tofacinib is an 
ionic medicine that is used to treat people with type 2 diabetes. It works by 
blocking a protein in the body’s immune system.  1  : n O 
Researchers wanted to learn more about the use of tofactinib in people

The most common symptom is pain in the spine, which can be severe enough to cause permanent disability. Spondylitis is caused by damage to the joints, such as the spine or the spine itself. 
 There is no cure for this disease, but there is an effective treatment for it.  The mainstay of treatment is to stop the damage caused by the damage done by the disease.  however, this may not work well for some people and may cause other long-lasting side effects.  There is a need to find new treatments for people with this disease that can help them to live longer and painless lives.  tofacitinib is a medicine that is being tested for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes. It works by interfering with the activity of the immune system, which leads to an increase in the body’s response to stress.  it is called an “antibody-lactamase inhibitor” (ALISA).   In this study, we wanted to find out more about the use of tofacinib in patients with type2 diabetes.  we compared 2 different doses of this medicine with the standard treatment for type 3 diabetes, called t-2 diabetes mellitus (T-2DM).  T-2dm has not been approved for use outside of research studies because it is still being developed.  in patients.  t-1 is a type 2 medicine that works by blocking the activity

Tofacinib is a medicine that is being tested for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.   Tofaitinhib works by reducing the activity of certain proteins in the body called erythropoietin (Erythropoiesis).  these proteins help the body to form  
   proteins called eosinophils (eosinoproteases).

The main purpose of the Tofacitinib Study Number:000226-58  General Study Name: TFP-010111 ©2021 EU-CTR Biopharma SRL LTD. All rights reserved. Clinical Study Results Tofacinib is an oralisotope that is used to treat patients with certain types of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are unable to control their pain and stiffness in their joints.    The study was done to find out if tofactinib could help people with RA who were unable to perform light daily activities, such as walking and sitting, to control pain, stiffness in the joints, and improve their quality of life.

 The mainstay was physical examination. The physical examination looked at the patient’s general appearance, skin (presence of rash), heent (head,eyes, ears, nose and throat), lungs (auscultation), heart (caused by murmurs, gallops, orubs), lower extremities (peripheral edema), abdominal (palpation and auscultation), neurologic (mental status, station, gait, reflexes, motor and sensory function, coordination) and lymph nodes (facial nerve connections).   and lymph node abnormalities. 
.  During the study, the study doctor did a check-up of the patients at several study visits.  At the first visit, patients were checked-up to see if they could be in the study 
:  Screening: Patients were checked for any abnormalities in their physical examination (e.g., heart, skin, heent, lungs, and nervous system). 
 Screening lasted for up to 48hours.  Week 16 was the last visit.  From week 16 to week 48, patients received either tofacitiniband or a placebo.  The placebo looked like the study drug but did not contain any medicine.  Study doctors use a placebo to help make sure it looks like the real study drug.  t  : n O  d e This summary only includes the results from the study.  Tofacitinib is a new drug being studied for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
 COPD is a long-term disease of the lungs that causes inflammation and pain in the lungs. 
 The exact cause of this pain is not known. However, it is thought to be caused by a mixture of factors that include genetics and environmental factors.  
 There is no cure for COPD, but there is a treatment that may help some people manage their symptoms.  tofacinib may reduce inflammation and reduce pain caused by the same or similar causes of COPD. It is being studied as a potential treatment for COPDER disease.  COPD affects the lungs of people with COPD and can cause symptoms such as chronic low back pain, abdominal pain, joint pain, and tiredness.  ) T M G (  1  : n O  d e d e v o r p p p A \ d e WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY? p A - 5  : d This study compared 2 groups of participants to find out if participants taking t M treated with t f 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 f 1 n a c p A would have an improvement in their COPD symptoms compared to participants taking a placebo.  d b e f 1 2 0 9 1 e 7 7 1 0 9 0 2 - 5 9 0 e 7 1 e 6 1 0 c e 6 0  0 2 9 0 d e The study included adult men and women aged 18 to 75 years who had copd and were not smokers or alcoholics.

It is approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes.    The main aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of 2 different doses of this medicine with placebo in patients with type 1 diabetes. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. 
 The study was done in 269 adult patients at our center.  • The patients were divided into 4 groups by the study doctor into 2 groups: 
 • Group 1 ( n=269) • Group 2 (n=268) • Placebo (n = 269) • Tofacinib (or a combination of the 2 medicines) • The study included patients with 
type 2 diabetes who were taking a combination medicine called tofazole (also known as tamoxifen and palliative care). 
Group 1: patients were treated with placebo. • The other 2 groups were as follows:  
 Group 2: patients treated with tofaca (also called palliate care) and group 3: patients 
treated with placebo
There were 269 patients in Group 1 and 269 patients  2 in Group 4.  The patients and doctors 
did not know who took tofacitiib and who took the placebo.

The exact cause of AS is unknown, but it is thought that it is caused by damage to the joints of the spine, especially the joints, called synovial vesicles (Svcs). Svcs can cause permanent damage to joints if they do not get treated.  There is no cure for AS, but there is a vaccine for the disease.

hormone-related fatigue syndrome (CORS-1). It is used to help people with chronic 
complicated chronic illnesses such as chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and 
alcoholism. It works by helping the body make 
different connections between energy and the rest of the body. 
Cors-1 uses a protein called p53 to help make connections between 
the energy and restorative signals in the brain. It is thought that this protein helps 
people with these conditions to control their energy and sleep 
sessions.  Tofacitiib is approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes.  
But, it is not approved for people with other types of chronic illnesses, like 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 liver disease, and type 3 diabetes. Tofaciib is 
being studied to see if it can help people

Why was the research needed? Ankylsosing sponds are bones in the spine. They can form into ball joints (spines) and joints (fibers) and are responsible for joint problems such as joint pain, stiffness, and loss of flexibility.  When the joint pain is severe, it can lead to permanent disability.  There is no cure for AS, but there is treatment for AS. T M g has the potential to improve symptoms, improve joint function, and reduce disability. The main aim of the this study was to find the benefits and safety of t m g in patients who received tofacitiniband, compared to placebo.  T m G is a medicine that lowers the activity of the spines. It is given by injection into the spine and stops the cells from forming ball joints.  Placebo is given as a dummy treatment. It looks like t mG but does nt have any medicine in it.

 Background and study aims:  Ankylosing spondyleitis (AS) is a long-term inflammatory disease of the joints. It can cause pain and stiffness in the spine, elbows, knees, and lower back.  T. c., BASDAi is a disease activity index.  Study design:  This report focuses on the results of a clinical study of t c. caspondylosis (AS).   participants were included in the study if they had:  • Completed the study and had symptoms of AS.  • A physical examination showed that the spine and elbows were painless. • Completed a physical examination revealed that the elbow joint was stiff. • Taken a physical exam at the study visit showed that there was pain in the lower back and buttocks. • A computer program was used to create a score for each participant. 
Study results:  Overall, 268 participants completed the study. The most common symptom was tiredness. The lowest was lower back pain. The highest was lower leg pain.  There were no significant differences between the groups of participants who received t c p c p study drugs and those who did not receive study drugs.  The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant.  p p A \ d e v o r p p This study showed that patients who received study drugs had an improvement in their AS symptoms compared with those who received no study drug.  t c spndylitis is an inflammatory disease.

The study was “Astreen 2020”, which means “to learn more about tafacitib in patients with AS.” Astreen is a drug that is being tested for the treatment of patients with an inflammatory bowel disease called AS.  Ankylosis refers to inflammation in the joints and the spinal cord. It can cause symptoms such as fatigue, spinal cord pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and stiffness in the morning.   Tofacsinib is being studied as a possible treatment for AS. It is being developed as a treatment for this condition.  The main aim of the study was to findout if tofacsib worked better than placebo in improving the symptoms of AS in patients.  Researchers wanted to answer this question:   How many patients in your study had improvement in AS after taking tofacaitib?   What were the main results of this study?  A total of 268patients took part in the study and were included in the analysis.  At the start of thestudy, the participants were asked about their AS symptoms and how they were doing.  1 month after they started taking tafacaitinibanded. The study lasted for about 4weeks.  During this time, there were 132 men and 136 women. The average age was 43years.  First, the patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they could join the study.  After that, they visited the study doctors every 2 weeks for the first 2weeks and then every 6 weeks thereafter.  Study doctors collected information about the patients’ AS symptoms over the course of about 4 months.  From the study visits, the researchers collected information on the participants’ medical history, physical exam, and blood samples. At the end of the trial, the study staff collected the data they needed to collect the information.  This is a summary of those results.  Clinical Trial Number: ASTreen2018-00026-58

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).   Overview    Why was this study done? Researchers are looking for a better way to treat COPD. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.   What was the main aim of this study?  Researchers wanted to find the best time window for patients with COPD to be treated with a drug.  The study started in March 2014 and ended in December 2018.  Why did this study end? Researchers have been looking for the right time window to test a drug to treat people who have COPD for a long time. The main goal of the study was to find a better time window when patients were treated with t. Inglebrandinib.  (tofacitiib).  The researchers found that the time window was shorter in patients who were treated by t. inglebrandins than in patients treated by placebo.  T. Inglesbrandinhibib is a drug that is approved to treat patients with other types of COPD, but it is not approved for use outside of research studies.  It works by helping the body to break down and remove foreign objects from the body.  Researchers planned this study in two parts of the body called the lungs. The lungs are the part of the lungs that can not be broken down.  Patients were treated in this study by inhaling and exhaling through a small incisor nostrils.  They were treated for up to 4 weeks.  1.5 years.  2.2.  3.0. Patients were divided into 2 groups of about 20 patients each. The first group was treated with placebo.

Overview    Why was this study done? Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with arthritis. Tafin is a type of arthritis that can cause damage to the joints and spinal cord. It can cause symptoms such as pain and swelling in the spine, loss of bowel control, and stiffness in the arms and legs.  Tafenib is approved for the treatment of patients with this condition. It works by blocking the activity of the immune system, which stops the body from rejecting foreign invaders.  tafanib (also known as bacillus calmette- barr o rryaska) is an oral medicine that is approved to treat osteoporosis (also called osteopontinosis).   In this study, we wanted to see how tafatinib works in patients who have previously been diagnosed with osteopositis (also referred to as osteopetrosis factor-1 ( OEF-1) or osteoprotegerin (or OEF for short) and who have been treated for other types of rheumatism. o

 It is used to treat dm by stopping the body from making certain proteins called tyrosine kinases (Tkss). Tks are proteins that bind to and trigger the body to make proteins called cytokines. 
Tks are thought to be involved in the body’s response to stress and other stressors. Tks can cause a wide range of diseases, including dm.  
 For example, dm1 is a protein that is found in the brain and spinal cord that is thought to play a role in the regulation of the immune system.  tks is also found in many other proteins in the nervous system.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 9, but it is unknown if tks acts similarly in people with dm and other types of diabetes.9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,33,34,35,36,37,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,49,50,51,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,63,or 59,or 62,or 63,or 64,or more.  1,0,0:  dm 1, 2,1,1: dm 0,1 0, 1,1 1,2 0, and 0,3 0, 0,4 0, 3,1 e, and 2,4 1,4 2,5 1,6 1,7 1, and 8, 9, and 64, and 1,9 1,10 1,11 1,12-,14-,16-,17-,24-,32-,40-,43-,44-,45-,46-,47-,48-,50-,54-, and  dd-,  50-,56-,59-,or  df-,and  dp-,63: dp, and dm-.

It is used to treat patients with RA who are unable to take part in a previous study or who are not taking their medicine due to other medical problems.    The main goal of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of tofacinib with placebo in children with RA.  rheumatism is a common condition that can affect the quality of life for children and teenagers. It can affect many different areas of the body, including the nervous system.  The condition is called RA. There is no cure for RA, but it can be treated with medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. There are many medicines that are available to treat RA. One example of these medicines is the prescription medicine called tafacitib.  Tafacitiib is approved to treat adults with RA and is available in the form of a tablet. It works by interfering with the normal function of the rheumatic system, which means that the body does not produce enough rheumaaginalic acid (RA).   Tifacititib is also approved to help treat RA and other forms of RA. In this study, we wanted to see how well tafaciib works in children who were not taking previous rheumi medicine.  tafacaib is given by injection into a vein in the arm.  0  0 2 weeks before the injection.  : n O   0 0 2 0   t o r The injection is a small needle biopsy taken from the vein and the blood sample.  1 0 2 to measure the amount of RA in the blood in the vein.  2 0 2   : 0  r p p p A \ d e v o r p  During the first week of the study, children were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance (like tossing a coin).  0 f 1 0  This is known as a randomized trial.  o r This is done to make the groups more even to compare.  d e the groups so that the groups can be compared.  f 1 2 0 3 0  : r p A 0  n O r p a \ d  Placebo = 0  1 n a \ c e v p A o r a r a p p \ f r p Tofacitinib is a new type of oralisofibroblast growth factor (EGF) that is being tested for use in patients with certain types of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

tofacitib is already available as a prescription medicine for patients with RA.  
 The main aim of this study was to find out how well tofacititib works in improving the quality of life (Qol) in patients 
with RA. The researchers wanted to know: 
How well did patients taking tofacitantib improve their qol compared to patients taking placebo? 
 
The researchers asked this question:  How well was it?    What were the main results of the study for patients taking 
tobacitib?  The researchers found that patients who took tofactitib had a 
better qol than patients who 
treated with placebo.
the researchers found this to be true for all 5 main qol measures.  The main results for patients who used tofacitateitib were Mobility, 
Self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression.
  The study also found that the patients who use tofacitiib had

The results from this study show Clinical Study Results Research Sponsor: Horizon Drug Studied: Horizon Biopharma SRL Treatment Studied - tofacitinib Study Purpose: Horizon is a research sponsor of this study. The purpose of this research was to learn more about the use of tofacaibibib in patients with postmenopausal hormonal disorders. The study was done to find out if tafacitib works for patients with menopause and postmenopause.  The study included menopausal women who: • Were diagnosed with postpartum hormonal disorders (menopexy and postpartomide). • Had a history of at least one episode of postmenstrual syndrome (pregnancy). • Were taking hormonal therapy for their postparton symptoms. • Were not taking any hormonal therapy before the study. • Had any other hormonal therapy in their body. • Did not have any hormonal disorder that could be linked to the study drug.    Menopause is a condition in which the body is unable to control or control its own hormones. It is characterized by a state of high levels of a hormone called testosterone (an example is anorexia pectoris).   The body produces too much testosterone in the form of an overactive t helper hormone (haemophilus influenzae) that causes the body to burn out and become too dependent on this hormone. This condition is called postpartoma.  Use of the data and information contained in this summary is unrestricted, provided it may not be used in applications by others for regulatory approval of a product.  Researchers are looking for a better way to treat postpartonal menopexercise hormone disorders.  (PKA) that can be used to treat these disorders. In this summary, we will describe the most common uses of testosterone in women.  :  Menopausal hormone disorders (Pka) are defined as:  : nadir (antiepileptic hormone disorder),  : d ephosphate phosphatase inhibitor (PKI) (a pika inhibitor),   : catecholamine receptor blocker (A pika blocker),  (a receptor blocker), and  : r p pika antagonists (a class of drugs that block the activity-related hormones)   Tafacinibib (also known as pika inhibitors).  There are many other hormonal disorders that affect the body. In pka inhibitors, the body does not use hormones to control its hormones.  There Clinical Study Results Research Sponsor: ltd.
