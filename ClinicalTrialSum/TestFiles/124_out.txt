 A study to learn how well glecaprevir and pibrentasvir work together in 
young people with chronic hepatitis C infection and compensated cirrhosis 
Who took part in this study?
Researchers wanted to find out:
Participants had cirrhotic hepatitis C cirrhoses in their 
cirrhosis, which means they had a 
severe infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and compensated 
irregularly.
This is a summary of results from one clinical study. 
We thank all study participants. You helped us toanswer important questions about 
how well glaprevir works and about the safety of it.
What was this study about?
This study was about finding out if glapervir and 
ribrentasvir work together to treat adults with HCV who have compensated cirhosis.
Who participated in this research?
Adults with chronic HCViral hepatitis C infected with type 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6 
genotype 1,
or 2,
were included in this 
study.
