Notes:
[1] - The number of subjects reported to be in the baseline period are not the same as the worldwide
number enrolled in the trial. It is expected that these numbers will be the same.
Justification: One randomized subject did not receive treatment as the subject deviated from the
protocol and was randomized in error.

second (FEV1) at Week 12
End point description:
To investigate the clinical efficacy of AZD7594 at different dose levels in asthmatics symptomatic on low
dose ICS (Full Analysis Set). Trough value was defined as the mean of the 2 measurements 30 minutes
apart (23 hours after last dose) pre-dose for every visit throughout the Treatment Period (Visit 4/Week
2 to Visit 7/Week 12). Baseline was defined as the mean of the 2 measured values before first
investigational product (IP) administration (30 minutes apart, at −45 minutes and −15 minutes, before
IP administration) on Day 1 (Visit 3).  Analyses were based on a Mixed-effects model for repeated
measures (MMRM) with treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction and region as fixed effects, and
baseline value and baseline by visit interaction as covariates.

apart (23 hours after last dose) pre-dose for every visit throughout the Treatment Period. Baseline was
defined as the mean of the 2 measured values before first IP administration on Day 1. Analyses were
based on a MMRM with treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction and region as fixed effects, and
baseline value and baseline by visit interaction as covariates. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with
treatment and region (ie, US, Japan, and Rest of the World [RoW]) as fixed effects, and baseline as
covariate was used for the analysis of average over the Treatment Period. The reported number of
subjects analysed corresponds to Week 2 and for Weeks 4, 8, 12 and average over the Treatment
Period, the number of subjects analysed are provided as comment in the row titles.

End point title Change from baseline in Fractional exhaled nitic oxide (FENO)
at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and average over the Treatment Period
End point description:
To investigate the clinical efficacy of AZD7594 at different dose levels in asthmatics symptomatic on low
dose ICS (Full Analysis Set). Baseline was defined as the last value obtained prior to the first dose of
investigational product. Analyses were based on a MMRM with change from baseline on the log-scale as
the response, treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction and region as fixed effects, and log-
transformed baseline value and baseline by visit interaction as covariates.
The reported number of subjects analysed corresponds to Week 2 and for Weeks 4, 8, 12 and average
over the Treatment Period, the number of subjects analysed are provided as comment in the row titles.

End point description:
To investigate the clinical efficacy of AZD7594 at different dose levels in asthmatics symptomatic on low
dose ICS(Full Analysis Set).Trough value was defined as the mean of the 2 measurements 30 minutes
apart(23 hours after last dose) pre-dose for every visit throughout the Treatment Period (Week 2 to
Week 12).Baseline was defined as the mean of the 2 measured values before first IP administration(30
minutes apart, at −45 minutes and −15 minutes, before IP administration) on Day 1. Analyses were
based on a MMRM with treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction and region as fixed effects, and
baseline value and baseline by visit interaction as covariates. Analysis of covariance with treatment and
region as fixed effects, and baseline as covariate was used for the analysis of average over the
Treatment Period. Reported number of subjects analysed corresponds to Week 12 and for average over
the Treatment Period, the number of subjects analysed are provided as comment in row title.

End point description:
To investigate the clinical efficacy of AZD7594 at different dose levels in asthmatics symptomatic on low
dose ICS (Full Analysis Set). Baseline was defined as the ACQ-5 score at Visit 3. Analyses were based on
a MMRM with treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction and region as fixed effects, and baseline
value and baseline by visit interaction as covariates. Analysis of covariance with treatment and region as
fixed effects, and baseline as covariate was used for the analysis of average over the Treatment Period.
The questionnaire has 5 items; each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 6, where higher scores represent
more severe impairment/symptoms. The overall ACQ-5 score is the average of the scores for each of the
questions included in the questionnaire. Reported number of subjects analysed corresponds to Week 12
and for average over the Treatment Period, the number of subjects analysed are provided as comment
in row title.

End point description:
To investigate the clinical efficacy of AZD7594 at different dose levels in asthmatics symptomatic on low
dose ICS (Full Analysis Set). Baseline was defined as the average over the 7 days prior to
randomisation. Analyses were based on an ANCOVA model with treatment and region as fixed effects,
and baseline value as a covariate. During the Run-in and Treatment Periods, subjects recorded the
severity of their asthma symptoms during night-time and day-time each morning and evening, using the
eDiary. Asthma symptom scores during night-time/day-time were assessed by the subject each
morning/evening according to the following scoring system and recorded on the eDiary: 0: No asthma
symptoms, 1: The subjects were aware of their asthma symptoms but they can easily tolerate the
symptoms, 2: asthma was causing enough discomfort to cause problems with sleep, 3: Subjects were
unable to sleep/do normal activities because of their asthma.

End point title Time to recurrent Composite endpoint for severe exacerbations
of asthma (CompEx) event
End point description:
To investigate the clinical efficacy of AZD7594 at different dose levels in asthmatics symptomatic on low
dose ICS (Full Analysis Set).
CompEx is a composite endpoint combining severe exacerbations of asthma and diary events. CompEx
is a composite surrogate endpoint for severe exacerbations of asthma, recently developed by
AstraZeneca (it is not yet a regulatory-approved clinical endpoint). Severe exacerbations are defined as
those episodes that lead to hospitalisation, emergency room visit and/or treatment with oral
corticosteroids. Time at risk was calculated as [(date of last treatment – date of randomisation)+1 –
recovery time. Recovery time was the sum (from i=1 to k) of (min with event end date +7, date of last
treatment] – with event start date +1). No statistical analysis is done for this endpoint.

analysis, with event count as the dependent variable, with treatment and
region as covariates and log-transformed time at risk (days) as an offset variable to account for
overdispersion.

Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
26 April 2019 Deletion of peak FEV1 from the secondary efficacy endpoints. Update of the
inclusion criteria to include only subjects with BMI ≤ 35. Deletion of the expected
number of subjects in the US vs. non-US sites. Removal of interim futility
analysis. Specification of inclusion criterion #7 (pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Visit 3
between 40% and 90% predicted). Deletion of QT interval corrected using
Bazett’s formula; addition of appropriate electrocardiogram parameters.
Clarification of exclusion criterion #3 and exclusion criterion #21 for alcohol and
drug abuse. Clarified the required treatments for postmenopausal subjects.
Clarified that the subjects were discontinued when specified criteria are met.
Deletion of measure peak expiratory flow at Screening. Clarification of the number
of measurement and timing of spirometry. Clarification of the compliance rate in
the Run-in Period and the expected compliance rate in the Treatment Period.
Clarification that peak expiratory flow was measured at home after completing the
morning and evening diary. Clarification that Forced oscillation technique
evaluation and training took place at Visit 1, instead of Visit 2. Deletion of the
description that rescue medication should be recorded as concomitant medication.
Clarification that the analysis set used for demographic and baseline
characteristics was Full analysis set. Clarification that baseline asthma severity
was assessed using the pre-SABA value at Visit 2, instead of pre-bronchodilator
value at Visit 1. The number of subjects who met the reversibility criteria was
deleted. “Individual plasma concentrations vs. time on Week 12 (Day 84) plotted
on linear and semi-logarithmic scale with all treatments overlaid on the same plot
and separate plots for each subject” was no longer provided as part of PK
analysis. Geometric SD was no longer presented on figures of geometric mean for
concentration-time data as part of the PK analysis. Clarification of the definition of
