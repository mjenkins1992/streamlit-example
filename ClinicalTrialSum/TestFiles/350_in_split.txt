Notes:
General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
Main objective of the trial was to describe the safety and efficacy of isavuconazole in the treatment of
invasive Aspergillosis in patients with renal impairment (RI) or in patients with invasive fungal disease
(IFD) caused by rare moulds, yeasts or dimorphic fungi.
Protection of trial subjects:
This clinical study was written, conducted and reported in accordance with the protocol, ICH GCP
Guidelines, and applicable local regulations, including the European Directive 2001/20/EC, on the
protection of human rights, and with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of
Helsinki. Astellas ensures that the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) obtained
during a research study complies with the federal, national and/or regional legislation related to the
privacy and protection of personal information.
Background therapy:
Participants eligible for the study were primarily, but not limited to, those with underlying hematologic
malignancies. Treatments for participants underlying disease were not standardized.
Evidence for comparator:
This study did not have a comparator arm. The choice of a uniform comparator for all patients included
in this study was not feasible due to the allowance of patients with IFD caused by many different rare
pathogens.

More information
Substantial protocol amendments (globally)
Were there any global substantial amendments to the protocol?  Yes
Date Amendment
16 October 2007 Amendment 1 issued on October 16, 2007, clarified the type of participants to be
enrolled, including changes requested by Regulatory Authorities. Clarifications
were made to the duration of study drug, clinical and mycological responses, and
to the timing of evaluations for secondary efficacy variables including the addition
that survival status should be assessed for all participants, including those
discontinued prior to day 42 or day 84 due to an unsuccessful outcome. The
ceiling for total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase
(ALT) abnormalities were decreased per regulatory advice. The estimated number
of centers that participated in the study was adjusted from 200 to 150.
27 May 2010 Amendment 2 issued on May 27, 2010, identified the change in the study
sponsorship from Basilea to Astellas. The project physician, biostatistician and
clinical pharmacologist were also changed. Isavuconazole dosing and the fasting
requirement for oral isavuconazole administration were amended. The prohibited
concomitant drugs were updated. The European Organization for the Research and
Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions of IFD were
changed from 2002 to the revised 2008 criteria.
17 November 2010 Amendment 3 issued on November 17, 2010, amended maximum duration of
therapy from 84 days up to 180 days and the timing of the first study drug
maintenance dose was also amended. The primary and secondary analysis and
efficacy variables were amended to specify that outcome criteria were assessed by
the DRC and Investigator and to add additional time points for analysis. The
exploratory analysis variables were amended to specify pharmacokinetic analysis
and the addition of analysis of serum galactomannan (GM) as a biomarker for
treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were also
amended and clarified. The criterion for withdrawing participants with possible IFD
was removed, and prohibited and cautionary drugs and drug-drug interactions
(DDIs) were updated. Various study procedures in the Schedule of Assessments
were amended, clarified and added. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan
(GM) was clarified as mycological criteria for enrollment of participants with
invasive aspergillosis. The Protocol was amended to classify these participants as
possible versus probable cases of IFD. Additional follow-up criteria for enrollment
of these participants were also added. The CLCr calculation was amended to
standardize reporting; ideal rather than actual BW was used in the calculation.
The laboratory tests albumin, p-amylase and lipase were also added, and an
improvement of < 25% was included in radiological response criteria.
11 June 2012 Amendment 5 issued on June 11, 2012, amended and clarified the efficacy
variables and analysis sets and modified the entry criteria. Entry criteria changes
included allowance of enrollment of participants on dialysis and of participants
with proven or probable invasive mucormycosis who required primary therapy,
and exclusion of participants who were enrolled in previous isavuconazole trials.
Sirolimus and tyrosine kinase inhibitors were added as medications to use with
caution, and clarification was added that statins could be discontinued at time of
first dose. Various study procedures were amended, clarified and added to the
Schedule of Assessments. The laboratory tests hemato

 crit and blood, urea and
nitrogen test (BUN) were added.

06 February 2013 Amendment 6.1 issued on February 06, 2013, added inclusion criterion 7, stating
that participants were not to participate in any other clinical trial within 30 days
prior to first administration of study drug. Exclusion criterion 12 was revised to
remove the exception that allowed concurrent participation in open-label
protocols; limited the enrollment to participants that had proven or probable IFD
caused by rare molds, yeasts or dimorphic fungi and participants who had proven
or probable invasive zycomycosis who required primary treatment; relabeled
inclusion criterion 5 as inclusion criterion 6; and clarified that no waivers to
inclusion or exclusion criteria were permitted. The total sample size was increased
from 100 participants to 150 participants to allow enrollment of specified subsets
of participants requiring primary therapy. As the sample size was increased and
the inclusion of participants with specific infections was limited, the sections of the
Protocol that were no longer relevant to participants to be enrolled under this
amendment were identified, and exclusion criterion 15 was removed to allow the
inclusion of participants with invasive aspergillosis. A section entitled End of Trial
in All Participating Countries was added to the Protocol, to define the end of trial
for this Protocol and allow for consistency throughout participating countries. The
Protocol was also updated to indicate that preliminary data suggested
isavuconazole may shorten the QT interval.
Notes:
Interruptions (globally)
Were there any global interruptions to the trial?  Yes
Date Interruption Restart date
01 January 2009 Enrollment in the clinical study was suspended in January 01 April 2011
2009 pending further characterization of newly identified
impurities.  After successful completion of the studies,
regulatory notifications, and transfer of Sponsorship from
Basilea to Astellas, resumption of enrollment occurred in
April 2011 for the 9766-CL-0103/WSA-CS-003 study
(hereafter referred to as 9766-CL-0103).
Notes:
Limitations and caveats
Limitations of the trial such as small numbers of subjects analysed or technical problems leading to
unreliable data.
Primary limitation is the non-comparative design. Conduct of a large randomized controlled study in
these rare diseases was not considered feasible. The results provide evidence that CRESEMBA is
effective for the treatment for mucormycosis.
