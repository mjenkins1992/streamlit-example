Notes:
General information about the trial
Main objective of the trial:
The main objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of risankizumab compared with
placebo in participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, the maintenance of response
following drug withdrawal after Week 28 through Week 104, and the response after re-treatment in
participants who experienced relapse after drug withdrawal and were re-treated with risankizumab.
In addition, this study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of risankizumab, emergence of
anti-drug antibodies, and the effect of anti-drug antibodies on efficacy and safety.
Protection of trial subjects:
Only participants that met all the study inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were to be entered in
the study. All participants were free to withdraw from the clinical trial at any time for any reason given.
Close monitoring of all participants was adhered to throughout the trial conduct. Rescue medication was
allowed for all participants as required.

End point title Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (PASI90) from
baseline to week 16
End point description:
PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the
extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and
area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-
point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score
ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is
defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent
reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at
Baseline * 100. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for missing data. Intent to treat (ITT)

End point description:
The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation.
Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none)
to 4 (severe). The sPGA ranges from 0 to 4, and is calculated as Clear (0) = 0 for all three; Almost clear
(1) = mean >0, <1.5; Mild (2) = mean ≥1.5, <2.5; Moderate (3) = mean ≥2.5, <3.5; and Severe (4)

End point title Percentage of Participants Achieving a Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQI) score of 0 or 1 at Week 16
End point description:
The DLQI is a 10-question questionnaire that asks the participant to evaluate the degree that psoriasis
has affected their quality of life in the last week and includes 6 domains (symptoms and feelings, daily
activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment). Responses to each domain
are not relevant (0), not at all (0), a little (1), a lot (2), and very much (3). The DLQI is calculated by
summing the scores of the questions and ranges from 1 to 30, where 0-1 = no effect on patient’s life, 2-
5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, and 21-30 = extremely large effect
on patient’s life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. NRI was used for missing
data.

PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the
extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and
area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-
point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score
ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI75 is
defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. The percent
reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at
