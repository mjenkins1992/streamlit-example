Why was this study done? What is ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. UC affects the mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Patients with UC experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares. Flares are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as sense of urgency. Flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years. There is no known cure for UC. Treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of UC and can even lead to long-term remission. However, there are few treatment ) T M options for patients with moderately to severely active UC. Medication is the most G common treatment for UC. (  8 1 : 9 What is tofacitinib? 0  1 2 0 Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. It is 2 - y an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved, and is available by a M prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to severe UC that did not respond - 9 2 well to other medications.  : n O  d What was the purpose of this study? e v o r Researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants p p A with UC when taken over a long period of time. \ d e v o r p Researchers wanted to know: p A \ 5 a How many participants had medical problems during this study? 3 6 8 2 7 9 1 e 7 7 1 0 9 0 What happened during the study? How was the study done? Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. Participants who were a good fit were assigned to receive either tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) or tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth, depending on whether they had UC symptoms when this study started. Participants with no symptoms (known as being “in remission”) received tofacitinib 5 mg, and participants with symptoms received tofacitinib 10 mg. The dose could be adjusted during the study, if needed.  This was an “open-label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose they received.  ) T M Participants were expected to attend visits at the study center every 3 months, and G ( complete a 4-week follow-up period after they finished study treatment.  8 1 : 9 0 The figure below shows what happened during this study.  1 2 0 2 - y a M - 9 2  : n O  d e v o r p p A \ d e v o r p p A \ 5 a 3 6 8 2 7 9 1 e 7 7 1 0 9 0 Where did this study take place? The Sponsor ran this study at 298 locations in 31 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, Europe, North America, and South America. When did this study take place? It began on 1 October 2012 and ended on 6 August 2020. Who participated in this study? This study included adult men and women who:  Had moderate to severe UC  Had participated in a previous study with tofacitinib  Had not had surgery for UC and were not likely to need surgery for UC during the study ) T  Did not have other bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, infectious colitis, M G or colon cancer (  8 1 : 9 0  A total of 555 men participated  1 2  A total of 389 women participated  0 2 y-  All participants were between the ages of 18 and 81 a M - 9 Participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to 2  : n benefit from it, or until the study ended.

The amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. The entire study took almost 8 years to complete. When the study ended in August 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report. What medical problems did participants have during the study? The researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study.  Participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). Or, medical problems could T) also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was M G taking. Sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown.
